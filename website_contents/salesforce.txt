Sales Cloud Pricing FAQ
Are there upfront costs or additional fees?
Salesforce has all kinds of add-ons, apps, and additional products to help your company stay ahead in your industry. Call us at 1800-420-7332 to discuss exactly what kind of products you’re looking to add and how we can help.
What if my business priorities and product needs have changed?
We know things don’t always go according to plan, and we’re here and will try our best to support. Reach out to a sales representative at 1800-420-7332 to discuss options.
Do Salesforce products integrate with outside applications and systems?
In many cases, Salesforce products integrate directly with many outside applications and systems to help you connect your data. For those that don’t have built-in integration, like on-premises data sources, you can purchase licenses of MuleSoft, work with our integration partners, or use apps on AppExchange.
Talk to a sales representative to get an idea of what integration solution works best with the Salesforce products you use.
What support and service packages are available?
We offer several advisory, adoption, and support plans to our customers. To learn more, visit
Success Cloud
.
How long are your contracts?
Most Salesforce products use annual contracts, but Salesforce subscription terms vary. Chat with a sales representative to discuss payment and billing options for your products.
Can I upgrade at any time? Can I add more products later on?
You can add products or upgrade at any time, but some products may need to scale together. Reach out to our sales department at 1800-420-7332 to see what works for your business.

In 2001, two young entrepreneurs fresh from engineering college embarked on a mission to make buildings smarter. What began as a 3-member startup in a 150 square foot office in Mumbai quickly grew into one of Indiaâs leading master system integrators (MSIs) with 300+ personnel, six offices, 1,000+ completed projects, and 26 awards.
âSecutech helps buildings, cities, and industries accelerate their digital transformation through IoT,â says Aditya Prabhu, Co-founder and Group CEO at Secutech Automation India Pvt. Ltd. âWe give customers a single view of their buildingsâ performance by integrating data from various systems into our IoT platform. These insights help enhance a buildingâs efficiency, comfort, and security.â
Secutechâs clients include Fortune 500 giants like Google India, Adani, Reliance, Tata, and Cisco. The companyâs work on the Cisco campus in Bangalore earned it the
2010 Buildy Award for the Worldâs Smartest Building
.
âSince COVID-19, the demand for smart buildings has been driven by six key business imperativesâthe need to protect occupant health and well-being, reduce operational costs, strengthen productivity and collaboration, improve sustainability, ensure security, and enable predictive building maintenance,â says Prabhu.
Secutechâs success lies not just in its technical ability to meet these needs, but also in its customer-first approach.Â
âWe strive to respond proactively to customer expectations at every stageâfrom capturing their vision, to managing their projects, to meeting service requirements,â says Prabhu. âBeing this proactive requires complete customer data transparency. And thatâs where Salesforce has made a difference. It gives us real-time intelligence to drive sales, projects, and services.â
One platform, infinite possibilities
Earlier, Secutech used different solutions for sales, service, and project management. But as the company matured and scaled, the limitations of these tools became apparent.
âManaging a sales cycle today is not just about looking at dashboards and pipelinesâeven spreadsheets can help you do that,â says Prabhu. âBut a good CRM helps you use your data logically to drive positive business outcomes.â
Salesforceâs platform-based approach offered Secutech two advantages. The first was the potential to connect data across systems, thus improving data transparency. The second was the flexibility to customise Salesforce at a micro-level to meet evolving business needs.Â
âWith Salesforce, wherever we find a gap, we can create new functionalities or workflowsâoften in just a few hours,â says Prabhu.
Digitising customer engagement without losing the personal touch
Secutech implemented Salesforce Sales Cloud to digitise its entire sales journeyâfrom campaign management to lead and opportunity management. Sales reps can now sell from anywhere because all the information and tools they need are just a click away.Â
Salesforce also integrates with multiple third-party applications, pulling in and consolidating data into a single source of truth. All customer contacts, events, and alerts are now easily shared among teams on Slack through Salesforce. Similarly, customer emails sent via Gmail are automatically tracked on the solution.Â
Since sales teams no longer have to switch between multiple systems to find data, their productivity has improved. They can also use customer data with Salesforce Campaign Management to create personalised marketing campaigns.
âEvery opportunity we bid for is evaluated by a mix of decision-makersâso, the way we market to each of them also has to be different,â explains Prabhu. âWith Salesforce, we have such in-depth visibility into each customer stakeholder that our messaging is highly targeted and personalised.Â
âDespite not meeting customers face-to-face since COVID-19, weâve been able to engage with them effectively through our digital campaigns. In fact, our brand recall value has improved by over 100%.â
Secutech is also improving partner engagement across a wide range of vendors. Earlier, each vendor had to be individually mailed for a cost proposal. But now, multiple vendors can be sent a common request for quote (RFQ) at one time.Â
âWhat used to take us three hours to do can now be completed in 30 minutes,â notes Prabhu.
Delighting customers with faster, better service
Secutech doesnât just install smart building solutionsâit also helps maintain and service them.Â
Earlier, service processes were largely manual and siloed. Support tickets were created on spreadsheets. Field service data was scattered across texts, emails, and WhatsApp messages. Plus, a high number of manual touchpoints led to communication gaps between field service engineers and customers.
With Salesforce, these challenges have been solved. Service processes are now faster, more streamlined, and more efficient. Teams have full visibility into service contracts, SLAs, and product inventories. Support tickets are automatically generated and converted into work orders on Salesforce Service Cloud.Â
Meanwhile, intelligent scheduling tools on Salesforce Field Service enable supervisors to automatically assign on-site jobs to the right service engineers based on skills and availability. Using the Field Service mobile app, engineers can manage jobs on the go with instant visibility into schedules, customer service history, and more.
Real-time data on engineer attendance and time spent on-site keeps customers updated on the progress of their service request, while enabling supervisors to evaluate engineersâ skills objectively.
Once a service request is fulfilled, the customerâs signature is digitally captured, and a report is provided on the spot.Â
âNo longer do we have to worry about paper-based service reports being lost or torn,â says Prabhu. âAll the data is digitised on Salesforce, which makes it easier to audit complaints.â
Finally, real-time visibility into overdue customer complaints helps service teams close out issues faster. As a result, escalations have reduced by 22%-25%.
Dreaming big
Secutech is now focused on achieving its vision of âSecutech 5.0â â simplifying customersâ digital transformation journeys.Â
âIn the smart buildings market, weâre the only Indian SME competing on the same level as industry giants,â says Prabhu. âWhat sets us apart is the quality of customer experiences we deliver because our sales and services processes are so streamlined and customer-centric.â

Razorpay partners with Salesforce to streamline sales processes and operate efficiently at scale
Razorpay, established in 2014, started off as an online payment gateway platform. Over the years, the company has evolved into a full-stack financial solutions platform, offering money management and banking services to businesses as well.Â
âAs more and more businesses move online, they are looking for solutions that allow them to grow rapidly, while also helping them to navigate the digital bandwagon,â explains Dushyant Panda, Head of Marketing â SME, Razorpay India. âThese businesses often spend a lot of time on finance and payment related activities at the backend, which gives them less time to focus on their core business.
âWe want to make it easier for businesses to accept money from their customers, and we want to help drive their growth by simplifying their financial layer.â
Every business decision at Razorpay is backed by this customer-centric vision to help businesses grow. That includes both offering innovative products as well as smooth customer experiences.Â
This demanded a solution that could help drive internal efficiencies as well as boost customer delight.Â
The need for a robust CRM solution
Razorpayâs previous CRM solution was not integrable with some internal platforms. ThisÂ  limited its scalability. Sales teams had to continue to rely on different tools for different purposes.Â
âWith limited visible impact, the uptake of the system was also limited,â says Pranav Marathe, Principal Solutions Consultant, Razorpay India. âMoreover, it had limited reporting capabilities.âÂ
As the sales teams grew, there was also a need for enabling the sharing of ground-level insights across teams. âAn interaction with a customer can hold different insights for different teams. We needed a central CRM solution that would enable information flow in an efficient manner,â says Chunmun Gupta, Sales Strategy Head, Razorpay India.Â
This solution also had to be easily customisable to adapt to Razorpayâs evolving requirements. The search for a more robust CRM solution led the team to Salesforce.
Consolidating sales activities on a single platform with Salesforce
The sales team at Razorpay uses Salesforce to streamline and automate their sales activities. By streamlining lead and account management, and integrating their internal systems with Sales Cloud, the teams can assign and prioritise leads much faster.Â
âThanks to Salesforce, the turnaround time from when a lead is captured, to when the sales team closes it has reduced, improving the customer experience,â says Gupta.Â
Merchants are now contacted within minutes of submitting their interest on the website, and the effective streamlining of this process has led to a 38% increase in conversion.Â Â
Once a lead is successfully converted, Account Managers are easily able to access customer touchpoint details on the platform. This unified view helps them personalise their customer interactions.Â
âWith everyday sales activities consolidated on one platform, Salesforce has helped improve the efficiency of our sales teams,â says Gupta. This has led to a 30% increase in overall efficiency of the sales team.Â
âNow that the impact of our digital initiatives is more visible, solution adoption by the sales team has also increased,â says Marathe.
“
By bringing reporting on to Sales Cloud, we now rely on Salesforce as the single source of truth for sales teams. ”

Delivering innovative products and delightful customer experiences
Razorpay has built customised workflowsÂ  on Salesforce to address their unique needs. For instance, one such process allows salespeople to capture any new/custom requirements discovered during customer interactions directly in the system. This isÂ  then passed on to the relevantÂ  teams for evaluation and implementation, helping Razorpay uphold its customer-centric vision.Â
Also, the company runs customer satisfaction surveys through Salesforce to gather feedback on its service from customers. Insights from the survey help the team to identify gaps and work towards bridging them.
âFor instance, the surveys indicated that our customers expected a lower turnaround on service requests.Â  Based on this feedback, we were able to make process changes at our end that brought turnaround times more in line with the customer expectations,â says Gupta.Â
Today, turnaround time on service requests has reduced from 48 hours to a swift 8 hours.
A unified view enables strategic planning
With access to various data now consolidated on one platform, Razorpay uses insights from the data to plan sales strategies more efficiently.Â
âBy bringing reporting on to Sales Cloud, we now rely on Salesforce as the single source of truth for sales teams. It provides a uniform view that helps with better forecasting and pipeline management,â says Gupta.Â
As companies in India rapidly digitise, Razorpay has an exciting journey ahead.Â
âWe are particularly excited about our new business banking offering, which will help businesses manage money movements seamlessly,â says Panda. âOur solutions will help them to focus on their core product and services without having to worry about all their payment and banking needs.â
As Razorpay gears up for even more growth, the team wants to explore using Salesforce Einstein to automate business processes, and to help evaluate and analyse data from a business perspective.Â
âAt the end of the day, our mission is to deliver unparalleled customer experience and help drive entrepreneurship in the country,â concludes Panda.

Mahindra & Mahindra gives dealers and customers a smooth ride across touchpoints with Salesforce
IN
CUSTOMER STORIES
Mahindra & Mahindra has united 18,000+ dealership users and 400+ call centre agents on a single platform, enabling them to deliver connected customer experiences.
There are many reasons why Mahindra SUVs
rank among Indiaâs best cars
. For starters, their
safety is unparalleled
, thanks to advanced driver assistance aids like automatic emergency brakes and adaptive cruise control. Theyâre also built like warriors with up to 200hp turbo engines that allow them to scale some of the toughest and
highest terrains in the world
.Â
But the Mahindra experience goes beyond the adrenalin-packed ride, plush seats, and powerful engines. It starts the moment a prospect is interested in a Mahindra SUV, to when they meet a dealer for a test drive, to the actual purchase and beyond.
âAcross customer touchpoints, we have three key imperatives,â says Bhuwan Lodha, SVP & Chief Digital Officer, Auto Sector, Mahindra & Mahindra. âDeliver connected experiences. Simplify customer interactions. And future-proof our business. Salesforce is helping us put all these objectives into action across 400+ call centre agents and 18,000+ users working at M&M dealerships.â
Hereâs how Mahindra & Mahindra is empowering its dealers and employees to deliver more value to customers with
Salesforce Customer 360
.

Step 1: Integrate systems for a unified customer view
Step 2: Connect with customers 1:1 through contextual marketing campaigns
Step 3: Empower dealers to sell smarter
Step 4: Improve customer experiences and revenue with powerful insights
Step 5: Scale up success with customers at the centre
In Their Own Words...
The journey of purchasing a car is now omni-channel. In this video (3:37), learn how Mahindra & Mahindra is ensuring that customers have a consistent, personalised and connected experience across online and offline touchpoints.
1. Integrate systems for a unified customer view
Previously, Mahindra had a limited CRM system that didnât integrate with campaign management tools or the core dealer management system (DMS). So, leads from the call centre didnât always reach the appropriate dealer, and neither did they always have the right prospect context.Â
With no centralisation, marketing campaigns run by dealers didnât always align with those run by internal teams, resulting in haphazard customer communications. These limitations also resulted in a heavy load on the core DMS, which then suffered frequent downtime.Â
âWe quickly realised that the key to delivering superlative customer experiences is to simplify and streamline dealer experiences,â says Ritesh Shah, Head, Digital Product Management, Mahindra & Mahindra. âWhen we empower our dealers with the right tools and data, theyâre able to offer our customers more value.â
With this in mind, Mahindra set out to find a robust, integrable, and easily configurable CRM platform that would unite all dealers around the customer.Â
âSalesforce appealed to us for three reasons,â says Rakesh Dhar, General Manager, Technology & Platforms, Mahindra & Mahindra. âItâs cloud-first and scalable. It helps us connect customer interactions across touchpoints into one seamless experience. And it makes a 360-degree customer view possible.â
2. Connect with customers 1:1 through contextual marketing campaigns
âWith Salesforce, the entire customer journey from marketing and lead nurturing, to test-drive scheduling and vehicle bookings, is now managed on a single platform,â explains Lodha. âThis makes our dealersâ jobs easier, and our customer experiences smoother.â
Using
MuleSoft
, Mahindra has integrated Salesforce with its customer portal and DMS to enable the smooth flow of leads. âMuleSoft acts as a buffer layer, connecting various tools while lowering the load on our DMS,â says Shah. âSo, downtime is no longer an issue.â
Website leads flow smoothly into
Salesforce Marketing Cloud
where teams can personalise prospect journeys, and automate communications. With customer data harnessed from across sources, teams can understand prospects and customers better, and then deliver the right messages at the right time.Â Â Â
âOur campaigns are a lot more consistent, now that theyâre centralised and templatised,â says Dhar. âWe can even track the prospectâs preferred communication channel, and drive omni-channel engagement.â
Mahindra also uses
Marketing Cloud Advertising
to create targeted ads at scale on digital platforms. And with
Marketing Cloud Intelligence
, they can efficiently surface marketing insights on campaign performance.Â
âMarketing campaigns and customer lifecycle management have become much more effective with less effort,â says Shah.
âSalesforce appealed to us for three reasons. Itâs cloud-first and scalable. It helps us connect customer interactions across touchpoints into one seamless experience. And it makes a 360-degree customer view possible.â

3. Empower dealers to sell smarter
Mahindraâs 400+ call centre agents use Salesforce to capture over 100,000+ leads a month. With
Einstein
, these leads are scored to determine which ones have a higher chance of converting. âHigh scoring leads can be treated differently to improve the customer experience and optimise agent efforts,â says Shah.Â
These leads flow seamlessly to dealer sales consultants via a dealer portal built on
Salesforce Experience Cloud
.Â
âDealers can now pick up the conversation with a lead right from where the service agent left off,â says Shah. âWith automation, the lead response time has reduced by 50% from 30 minutes to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, the lead to opportunity ratio has gone up by almost 10 percentage points.â
More than 18,000 users at M&M dealerships across the country have been onboarded on Salesforce where they can view customer data, nurture leads, handle enquiries, schedule test drives, gather feedback, and manage bookings â all on-the-go through their Salesforce mobile app.
Says Lodha, âDealers too are our customers, and we want to help them succeed with the right tools.âÂ

Already, the feedback from dealers has been terrific.Â
âAt one dealership, the âenquiry to test driveâ conversion rate has improved from approximately 40% to 70%, thanks to real-time enquiry data and focused follow-ups,â says Lodha. âAnother dealer reported a 15-percentage point increase in their âtest drive to bookingâ conversion rate.âÂ
Dealers have also become more productive since all the information they need on open opportunities, bookings, test drives, and other metrics is readily available through CRM Analytics dashboards on the dealer portal. One dealership general manager reported freeing up two hours per day with real-time reports.
4. Improve customer experiences and revenue with powerful insights
Salesforce Sales Cloud
has been used to build a custom sales review process that maps to dealership reporting structures. So, if a dealer sales consultant is under-performing, or needs help closing a sale, the system throws up alerts for Mahindraâs area sales managers to provide assistance.
Mahindra will also use
CRM Analytics
to empower area sales managers with on-the-go insights on sales pipelines, dealer performance, number of enquiries per dealer, and more. These metrics can be used to guide dealers on how to improve their performance, and offer customers a consistent and personalised experience.
âOur vision is to become the benchmark for both dealer and end-customer experiences in the auto industry,â says Shah.Â
That vision extends to customer service as well. With
Salesforce Service Cloud
, call centre agents are able to resolve customer cases faster and more effectively.Â
âNo longer do agents have to toggle between multiple screens to find information,â says Shah. âEverything they need â from FAQs to call recording tools â is available on a single screen. They can also measure operational efficiency, average call time and duration, agent performance, and other metrics. Thatâs something they couldnât do earlier.âÂ
Mahindra is now well on its way to achieving a 360-degree customer view that can be accessed and enriched by anyone in the organisation.Â
âWeâre moving from the unknown to the known â from having very little visibility into customer journeys, to achieving an all-encompassing customer view that will help us truly hyper-personalise customer conversations,â says Lodha.Â
âNo longer do agents have to toggle between multiple screens to find information. Everything they need â from FAQs to call recording tools â is available on a single screen.â

5. Scale up success with customers at the centre
To accelerate the Salesforce implementation, Mahindra partnered with the
Salesforce Customer Success Group
.Â
âThe Salesforce customer success team played a key role in helping us focus on the right objectives, make the right decisions, and identify opportunities for success,â says Lodha. âWith their support, we confidently switched from outsourcing the Salesforce implementation, to owning it ourselves.â
Going forward, Mahindra plans to expand its use of Salesforce - for example, make more dealership processes mobile-based, while also improving customer interaction monitoring.
âWeâve just scratched the surface of whatâs possible,â says Dhar. âThereâs so much more we can do, especially with analytics. Eventually, we want to extend Salesforce to our other automotive segments, as well as to our other Mahindra Group businesses.âÂ
The company is now gearing up to roll out its new range of electric cars. Theyâre also investing in emerging technologies like AI/ML and AR/VR to transform customer interactions.Â
âWe want to become the most customer-centric company in the automotive sector and ultimately, the entire Indian market,â says Lodha. âSalesforce is helping us work towards that goal.â

What is Agentforce?
Agentforce
is Salesforce’s groundbreaking   suite of customisable agents and tools, deeply integrated with the Salesforce Platform that helps companies build, customise and deploy autonomous agents to support employees and customers. With Agentforce, you can get out-of-the-box templates for quickly building and customising AI agents that meet specific business requirements. These agents can also be personalised using familiar Salesforce tools, including prompt templates, Flows and Apex. Agents are able to carry out business tasks using a company’s CRM data, external data and metadata while adhering to strict privacy and security guidelines and action guardrails. Because these agents are completely integrated with your Customer 360 apps across sales, service, marketing, commerce and more, they can seamlessly hand off to employees right in the flow of work. You can collaborate with your agents as a true extension of your team in any Salesforce app, partner app or customised app you build.
What is an AI agent?
An
AI agent
is an intelligent reasoning application that can use data and large language models to conduct planning, task execution and conversations. An agent takes action based on a trigger, which can be changes in data, conversations and scheduled automations. It then uses that trigger to determine a plan of action. The plan of action is determined by the predefined topics assigned to an agent. A topic is a job to be done, complete with the instructions and set of actions the agent can execute to achieve that goal. The agent then reasons through the query, selects a relevant topic, selects the action to take and gathers the data required to execute. Agentforce is the platform where IT teams can define the following parameters for their AI agents.
Is Customer 360 a product?
Customer 360 is not one specific product; it’s an end state we help our customers achieve by using the breadth of our portfolio. We offer apps for virtually every team within your organisation, which means everyone-your employees
and
AI agents-can take action on a 360-degree view and is united around the customer to manage and grow customer relationships.
I’m just looking to get started with CRM and don’t think I need AI solutions yet. Is Salesforce right for me?
Yes. Our CRM apps are  designed to meet you exactly where you are today and help you to embrace the latest technologies. Some organisations may just need one of our market-leading CRM solutions to support a single department or business goal, while others may benefit from connecting more of their teams and data on an AI-powered CRM platform to manage customer relationships more holistically.
Find a solution tailored to fit the needs of your business and context by answering four quick questions.
How do I know Salesforce can deliver results for my business?
We’re proud of the results our customers see with Salesforce. But you don’t have to take our word for it. A customer survey completed in August 2024 revealed 99% of our customers achieved positive ROI with Salesforce and 99% were satisfied with Salesforce. On average, customers report a 30% faster response to customers, 30% faster decision-making, 30% more employee productivity and 29% more teamwork, among other metrics, across their entire Salesforce implementation. Read our
customer success stories
to learn more about the value Salesforce provides.
How is Salesforce priced?
We offer a variety of pricing options for our customers, including:
Starter Suite, Pro Suite or Foundation Suites: When you select a suite, you get a bundle of some of our most popular features in one package to create a Customer 360 out of the box across sales, service, marketing, commerce and Data Cloud. Starter Suite is great for startups, whereas Foundations provides a more robust set of features for more established businesses.
Add-ons: Each add-on you select helps you to customise your CRM solution to get exactly what your organisation needs. We offer add-ons with different tiers of functionality, which is similar to how our editions have varying levels of functionality for most products.
To learn more, please visit the
Salesforce Product Pricing
page.
Is AI included in all Salesforce apps and solutions?
Customers must purchase product-specific add-ons to take advantage of Agentforce  and other generative AI capabilities embedded within Salesforce clouds. However, many predictive AI features are offered as add-ons to our standard cloud editions.

with our sales team to learn more.
My business is a non-profit. Can Salesforce help me?
For organisations in the non-profit, education or philanthropy sectors, Salesforce offers
Nonprofit Cloud
, a special version of our CRM platform and other solutions that can power your organisation’s purpose.
Keep in touch
to our team of experts to unlock the best solutions for your organisation.
As always, our representatives are available for a no-pressure consultation to help you figure out the best solution for your budget and business needs. We can find the services and packages that will serve your current needs, with plenty of options for growth in the future.
Does Salesforce integrate with other applications? How?
Salesforce CRM apps are deeply integrated, as they operate from one core platform with one metadata framework that creates a common language across apps. This means you can customise something in one app — for example, a customised object specific to your business like a “pet name” for an animal hospital or a “vehicle” for a car dealership — and that same customisation can appear across every other app, automatically. In addition, Salesforce is open to external apps and technologies by design, because we never want to box our customers into solutions. Our platform is built to provide a seamless back-end experience with any external partner, model, data store or productivity suite you currently use. We also operate a robust SaaS marketplace, AppExchange, where partners build customised apps to extend your use of Salesforce.
You can also integrate any system with Salesforce thanks to MuleSoft, the world’s #1 integration and API platform owned and operated by Salesforce. With the MuleSoft Anypoint Platform™, you can connect any system, application, data and device to unleash the full power of the #1 AI CRM.
And we know how important unified data is to trusted AI, so we make it easy to bring in any external data to Salesforce with our
Zero Copy Partner Network.
Zero copy enables organisations to easily connect and use all of their data within the Salesforce Platform without needing to move or copy data between platforms. Learn more about zero copy
here
.
How does Salesforce create a 360-degree view of my customer if our data is living in silos and disparate systems?
It’s entirely too common for data to be sitting in silos and disconnected from the customer experience. That is why we created
Data Cloud
, which brings all your disconnected enterprise data into Salesforce to deliver a comprehensive, 360-degree view of your customer. When we say all your data, we mean it:
MuleSoft
, the world’s #1 integration and API platform, connects data from anywhere (yes, even mainframes) so you can unite all your islands of data to get a complete view of your customers and business. And our
Zero Copy Partner Network
enables organisations to easily connect and use all their data within the Salesforce Platform without needing to move or copy data between platforms.
When you get all your data together in one place, you can do amazing things with
Tableau
to explore data, uncover insights and take action across your CRM to better serve your customers. Together, our data solutions empower your people with access to real-time data and insights about your customers and their interactions with your products and services, enabling them to deliver personalised customer experiences at every touchpoint.
How are Salesforce AI solutions different from public generative AI models?
Public generative AI models can do amazing things, but the model learns from everything you enter into your prompts. That’s why enterprise AI is different — you certainly can’t have public models learning from your sensitive customer data.
Salesforce helps you to harness AI to deliver impactful customer experiences across your business with data privacy and security built in. Our Einstein Trust Layer prevents sensitive data from leaving the Salesforce trust boundary, so you can use AI in every app, across every user and in every workflow across your CRM with confidence.

AI for business

Weâve never cared about sales targets. What matters is delivering the best possible experiences to our customers and channel partners. Salesforce is integral to that vision.”

Balaji Wafers delivers crisp and appetising distributor experiences with Salesforce
In 1981, three brothers hailing from a farming family in Gujarat began frying potato chips in their backyard to sell at a local cinema canteen in Rajkot. Little did they know that this modest entrepreneurial venture â christened Balaji Wafers â would become a Rs
2,000 crore-plus snack food brand with the biggest market share in four Indian states
.
âWhat differentiates Balaji Wafers from the Goliaths of the FMCG industry is that we remain grounded and laser-focused on the consumer,â says Shyam Virani, Director at Balaji Wafers. âYou wonât find another brand of packaged snacks that delivers the quality, quantity, and price we do.â
The company is certainly onto something. Their products, which range from the classic salted potato chips to âdesiâ foods like gathiya and aloo sev, to âIndianisedâ western snacks like chilli cheese nachos â are the talk of the town.
âOur philosophy is simple â offer the tastiest snacks, and make them easily accessible to the consumer,â says Virani. âWe also ensure the freshest products by supplying retailers twice a week instead of the industry average of once a week,â he continues.
Thanks to this consumer-first approach, Balaji Wafers is
growing at an impressive 20% year-over-year
with 50+ products, 5,000+ employees, three automated factories, and a strong foothold in 12 Indian states.
But itâs their distribution muscle that Virani believes is one of their biggest strengths.
âWe wouldnât be where we are without our 1,200+ distributors and 450,000+ retailers,â says Virani. âThey give our products wings.â
Chipping away at data barriers
To help distributors sell easier, Balaji Wafers first built a dealer management system that automated tedious tasks like record-keeping, and improved visibility into billing.Â Â
The next step was to help 125+ sales reps manage and audit channel partners more efficiently. At the time, partner surveys and findings were largely subjective, and therefore, hard to analyse. Moreover, data from field visits and audits was scattered across spreadsheets, emails, and text messages, making it difficult to track.
âWe needed a solution that would unify, streamline, and transform data coming from our channel partners into actionable insights,â says Virani.
Salesforce Consumer Goods Cloud ticked all the boxes.
âNo other platform comes close to Salesforce in terms of sales and marketing capabilities,â says Virani. âItâs stronger, faster, more secure â and therefore, more trustworthy. Plus, we donât have to worry about updating the platform ourselves to keep up with changing market trends â Salesforce takes care of all that.â
Spicing up sales productivity through better mobility and data visibility
Using Consumer Goods Cloud, Balaji Wafers has streamlined the end-to-end process of managing and auditing distributors and retailers. All interactions with channel partners are now captured on the Salesforce mobile app.
âEarlier, we didnât know why some distributors were taking longer than others to be onboarded,â recounts Virani. âNow, we can track the entire process - from when a distributor inquiry is received on our website, to when itâs assigned to a sales rep, to all the back-and-forth communication after that, leading up to distributor onboarding. Bottlenecks are instantly spotted and fixed. As a result, distributor onboarding time has reduced by 50%.â
Field sales have also improved. Using Salesforce Maps, the company can identify the GPS locations of all retail stores in an area, and plan the distributorâs sales territory accordingly, re-carving it when new stores come up.
âUsing Salesforce Maps has helped us improve the accuracy of mapping our dealer and retailer locations by 80%,â says Virani. Sales supervisors also use Salesforce Maps to coordinate field teams, optimise route plans, and schedule visits to the right channel partners at the right time.
âWith smarter field planning, our reps are more productive,â says Virani. âThe number of visits to partners has increased by 30% per rep per week.â
At the partner site, reps know exactly what needs to be done using the Salesforce Retail Execution App. All tasks and data around retail audits and surveys can be managed on-the-go. Itâs a far cry from the days when audit findings had to be captured on paper, and manually uploaded to spreadsheets.
âToday, field reps have all the data and tools they need at their fingertips, even before reaching a distributor warehouse or retail store,â says Virani. âAs a result, audits are faster and smoother.â
Audits have also become more objective and checklist-based. So, the data is easier to compile and analyse.

Using Salesforce Maps has helped us improve the accuracy of mapping our dealer and retailer locations by 80%.â”
“
Using Salesforce Maps has helped us improve the accuracy of mapping our dealer and retailer locations by 80%.”
Sweetening distributor performance with rich insights
Balaji Wafers has built a 360-degree view of distributors â including their sales metrics, infrastructure details, audit results, and potential growth opportunities. These insights are used to help distributors understand how and where to improve their business.
âWe donât just want to sell more products â we want to empower our channel partners to be successful,â says Virani.
Field reps also survey retailers to understand how their service experience can be optimised. One survey found that retailers in busy locations like railway stations want to be supplied six times a week rather than only twice. Intelligence like this enables distributors to serve their territories better, while also improving their own profitability.
The leadership team is also benefiting from Salesforce. They now have a clearly mapped view of sales territories which helps them identify and fix market gaps. They can also use a virtual, 360-degree view of channel partners to have more meaningful distributor conversations. By identifying which distributors are performing the best and why, they can help other distributors improve their game. And with real-time sales insights, they can quickly spot issues in the value chain.
âEarlier, weâd analyse sales trends only at the end of the month,â says Virani. âSo, if a distributorâs sales dropped from week one to week four, it would take us 45 days to find out and do something about it. But with Salesforce, sales trends are tracked every week. So, weâre now able to spot and resolve issues in just 15 days.â
A recipe for success
To implement Salesforce, Balaji Wafers enlisted the help of Aethereus Consulting.
âAethereus was very supportive and flexible, often understanding our needs better than we did,â says Virani. âHaving worked with other companies in the industry, they knew a number of best practices that would benefit us. And even after Salesforce was rolled out, they continued to help us improvise and iterate based on user feedback.â
The company wants to now build a pan-India presence where more consumers can enjoy tasty and healthy snacks with an Indian twist.
âWeâve never cared about sales targets,â states Virani. âWhat matters is delivering the best possible experiences to our customers and channel partners. Salesforce is integral to that vision.â

Salesforce CRM for Small Business FAQs
General
Artificial Intelligence for Small Business
What is CRM?
CRM stands for customer relationship management, which is a solution for storing and managing prospect and customer information, like contact info, accounts, leads and sales opportunities — all in one central location. But it’s not just a fancy contact list. A CRM solution is one of the most valuable, game-changing pieces of business technology available because of how it uses that customer info.
How can CRM help me make more sales?
At the heart of a CRM solution is something called sales force automation (SFA). SFA combined with CRM automates some sales functions, so you can accelerate and streamline the sales process. Put all your customer information in one place, so your team can access it from anywhere. No more spreadsheets, searching through emails or looking for a sticky note. You can move leads through your sales team quickly and easily. That’s the power of customer relationship management — CRM.
Can a CRM solution help me to find more leads?
The right CRM solution can give you access to contact databases that can be filtered to find your ideal prospects and decision makers within a company, provide social data on those contacts and deliver insights into what customers are talking about. This makes territory planning and white space analysis easier as well.
A complete CRM solution also helps companies run and track marketing campaigns, including marketing communications and delivery automation. It can even help create forms for lead capture and track performance. And for those leads that are not sales ready, you can even automatically put them in a nurture track so that when you do call, they are more likely to buy.
How can CRM help me to keep my customers happy?
With solutions that range from self-help pages (that allow agents to focus on the tough cases), to full call centres, CRM brings immense value to customer service teams. Your service reps can also use it to generate service tickets and keep track of all your customers’ contact with your service department. And, because the entire system is connected, account reps and every other relevant department will be fully aware of customers’ issues, so everyone can be a service agent when you need them to be.
Insights about customer service issues can be shared and added to a knowledge base so that agents can help customers even faster. In addition to shortening case resolution time, this kind of connected service also makes agents happier. It all comes down to giving them the tools to do more for customers — which in turn drives customer loyalty and referrals.
How do I know if my small business needs CRM?
If you’re still not sure if your small business would benefit from CRM, below are some clues that can help you in your decision.
Signs You Need CRM
If anything on this short checklist sounds familiar, CRM might be worth exploring to help your business find, win and keep customers more efficiently.
You have teams that work closely together, even when not actually together
Your sales teams are often on the road
You are unable to quickly find customer data to make decisions fast
You feel deals are falling through the cracks because you’re managing things in spreadsheets and notebooks
You have a patchwork of apps that you call CRM but they are not really connected on top of a single database or “system of record”
Your business is growing more quickly than you feel ready for
You know that your business’ customer service experience is lacking or you are losing more customers because of service issues than you’d like
You or your IT department is buried with maintenance requests
Why Salesforce for my small business CRM?
The World's #1 Choice
With hundreds of thousands of customers and millions of users, Salesforce is a proven choice and the #1 CRM in the world.
The CRM Cloud Pioneer
We actually pioneered cloud computing in 1999. No hardware. No software. Just sign on and get going.
Solutions Specifically for Small Business
Salesforce offers many packages, including sales, customer service and marketing software solutions. Even better, they're integrated to work as one complete CRM solution for your business.
Automatic Upgrades
Because Salesforce is 100% cloud-based, we can deliver three automatic upgrades every year based on customer input. Even better, the upgrades won't break your business’ customisations.

A Solution that will Grow with You
Salesforce offers an extendable set of tools — from preintegrated business apps on the AppExchange to point-and-click tools to build and customise your own apps — that give you just what you need, when you need it. So when you’re ready for growth, we can help.
What is AI in CRM?
AI in CRM refers to the use of artificial intelligence technologies, such as machine learning and natural language processing, to improve customer relationship management. It enables businesses to automate and optimise CRM activities, such as lead management, customer segmentation and sales forecasting.
How do I choose the right AI CRM software?
When choosing the right AI software, it is crucial to prioritise a commitment to trust as the number one value. Look for providers with a strong reputation for data privacy, security and ethical practices. Ensure that the software adheres to industry standards and regulations to protect customer data.
Additionally, consider the transparency and explainability of the AI algorithms used by the software. Look for providers that provide clear insights into how the algorithms make decisions and offer explanations for their recommendations. Evaluate the software's track record, customer reviews and case studies to gauge its effectiveness and reliability.
Finally, consider the scalability, integration capabilities and user-friendliness of the software to ensure that it aligns with your business needs and can be easily adopted by your team. By prioritising trust as the primary value, you can choose an AI marketing software that not only delivers results but also upholds ethical standards and protects your customer data.
How can AI be used for marketing?
AI marketing software offers businesses numerous benefits, including data-driven insights, scalable personalisation, automation of manual tasks, enhanced customer engagement, improved campaign performance, targeted segmentation, real-time and predictive analytics and adaptability. By leveraging advanced algorithms and machine learning, AI marketing software enables businesses to gain valuable insights from data, deliver personalised experiences at scale, automate time-consuming tasks, engage customers effectively, optimise campaigns, target specific segments and make data-driven decisions in real-time. This empowers businesses to enhance their marketing efforts, improve customer satisfaction and achieve better results in the ever-evolving digital landscape.
How can AI be used for sales?
AI can be used in sales to automate and optimise various sales activities, such as lead scoring, customer segmentation, personalised messaging and sales forecasting. It enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, free up time and improve sales effectiveness.
How can AI be used for service?
Some of the key benefits of AI for customer service and support are service team productivity, improved response times, cost reduction through automation, personalised customer experiences and more accurate insights and analysis. It enhances efficiency, enables self-service options and empowers support agents with valuable insights for better customer satisfaction.

Sales Cloud Pricing FAQ
Are there upfront costs or additional fees?
Salesforce has all kinds of add-ons, apps, and additional products to help your company stay ahead in your industry. Call us at 1800-420-7332 to discuss exactly what kind of products you’re looking to add and how we can help.
What if my business priorities and product needs have changed?
We know things don’t always go according to plan, and we’re here and will try our best to support. Reach out to a sales representative at 1800-420-7332 to discuss options.
Do Salesforce products integrate with outside applications and systems?

Pepe Jeans fashions seamless D2C interactions using Salesforce

CUSTOMER STORIES
Discover how Pepe Jeans India Limited is engaging online shoppers with rich and contextual ecommerce experiences.
Winding through Londonâs Notting Hill district is the famous Portobello Road whose vintage clothing market draws throngs of fashion lovers every week. It was here back in 1973 that an iconic denim brand was born.
âPepe Jeans London was the brainchild of three Indian-origin brothers who wanted to create some of the most exciting denim-led fashion on the planet,â says Manish Kapoor, Managing Director & CEO, Pepe Jeans India Limited. âToday, the brand is known for its authenticity and limitless creativity.â
In 1989, Pepe Jeans expanded into India, becoming one of the countryâs most popular premium denim and lifestyle brands.
âWeâre now a Rs 1,100 crore consumer sales business in India, with 250+ standalone stores, 700 department store counters, 700-800 multi-brand counters, and a presence across all leading ecommerce platforms,â says Kapoor.
Hereâs how Kapoor and his team at Pepe Jeans India are transforming online shopping experiences with
Salesforce Commerce Cloud
.

Step 1: Personalise customer interactions through D2C ecommerce
Step 2: Delight online shoppers with a fast and responsive website
Step 3: Strengthen decision-making with a unified customer view
Step 4: Accelerate implementation with effective teamwork
Step 5: Continue innovating for success
1. Personalise customer interactions through D2C commerce
For about 30 years, the Indian subsidiary of Pepe Jeans relied largely on partners and intermediaries to reach consumers. But now, with the aim of building a truly customer-centric business, the brand is going down the D2C route.Â
âWe want to cultivate a personal relationship with consumers, and communicate directly with them,â says Kapoor. âSo, in 2021, we launched our own website -
pepejeans.in
.â
The catalyst for this decision came even before COVID-19 when consumer behaviours began to change.
âMore consumers were shopping online, and we wanted to be present for them there,â says Kapoor.
To deliver great ecommerce experiences,
pepejeans.in
had to be supported by a robust solution. The company had two choices â deploy a basic ecommerce solution that would be up and running as soon as possible; or invest time and resources in a more scalable, stable, and future-proof platform.
âCreating a successful ecommerce business is a marathon, not a sprint,â says Kapoor. âYou need a platform that can be built on over time to keep up with changing customer needs. Thatâs why we chose Salesforce Commerce Cloud â because itâs designed for the long haul.â
In Their Own Words...
In this video (3:10), Manish Kapoor, Managing Director and CEO of Pepe Jeans India, shares how his company is wowing consumers with intuitive and personalised shopping experiences.
2. Delight online shoppers with a fast and responsive website
Today, Pepe Jeans uses Commerce Cloud to deliver seamless ecommerce experiences. Customers visiting the brandâs website can easily filter products, find what they need, fill their carts, and enjoy a quick checkout process. Theyâre also shown useful outfit recommendations based on about 30 pre-defined styles curated on Salesforce.Â
At the backend, teams can track exactly where drop-offs occur, and proactively fix any related issues. The result is a smooth purchasing funnel with only 1.4% of carts abandoned.
âThe India Pepe Jeans website is one of the fastest and most responsive across Pepe Jeansâ global operations,â says Priyaranjan Manay, Head of Marketing, Pepe Jeans India Limited. âPages load within three seconds for a first-time visitor and 1.6 seconds for a second-time visitor. Our SEO is also doing well with a score of 92.âÂ
Although the Pepe Jeans site is new, the volume of fresh sales being driven through it are almost on par with offline sales volumes. And as more consumers flock to the site, the company has decreased its reliance on online marketplaces to drive sales.Â
âIn the last 60 days, weâve been able to lower the discounts offered to marketplaces by five percentage points, thus reducing costs,â says Kapoor.

Meanwhile, developer-friendly tools make it easy to innovate on the site.
âOne of the best things about using Salesforce is that website changes can be made super-fast,â says Manay. âEvery week, weâre rolling out new creatives and pages â sometimes even changing the entire UI with ease.âÂ
But the companyâs vision isnât just to create a great website â itâs also to build a strong and engaged community around their brand. Using Salesforce, the team has integrated the website with social channels to amplify the brandâs reach and engagement. Theyâve also partnered with Indian celebrities and influencers to curate various âlooksâ using Pepe Jeans outfits on social media. If a consumer âlikesâ any of these looks, theyâre immediately redirected to the Pepe Jeans website to find out more.
âOur goal is to build a strong social connect with consumers,â says Kapoor. âWe want to go beyond sales and foster long-term customer relationships.â

3. Strengthen decision-making with a unified customer view
With vast volumes of customer data now available on Salesforce, Pepe Jeans can understand and engage with consumers better. The brand can also track consumer behaviour on the website, and gauge responses to products faster. These insights can then be incorporated into product design.Â
Meanwhile, rich reports and dashboards on Salesforce help leadership teams take informed action to improve the customer journey.Â
âAt the click of a button, we can view website traffic, bounce rates, conversions, and other key insights which help us make quicker, better decisions,â says Manay.

4. Accelerate implementation with effective teamwork
While the industry typically takes 9-12 months for an implementation of this nature, Pepe Jeans had its ecommerce site up-and-running in a record 100 days â thanks to excellent teamwork.
âWe set up a cross-functional implementation team of 14 people,â says Kapoor. âAnd we asked them to think as consumers rather than employees. What would they want from a website such as Pepe Jeans? Once they were able to articulate those needs, they were able to build incredible customer experiences using Salesforce.â
Supporting them at every stage was implementation partner, Metyis.
âMetyis was a solid partner,â says Manay. âSince theyâd already collaborated with our global business, they knew how to help us get the best value out of Salesforce. Working with them was seamless.â
to implement Salesforce (vs. industry average of 9-12 months)
Today, feedback on the website from global teams is very encouraging. Many of the lessons learned by the India team are being used across other markets.Â
Meanwhile, Indian employees are proud to have a local brand website. Not only does it give them a sense of ownership, but it also prompts them to think about how to digitise other business activities.
5. Continue innovating for success
Going forward, Pepe Jeans wants to be the #1 denim-centric fashion lifestyle brand in India.
âWeâre looking to grow at a 20% CAGR over the next three years,â says Kapoor. âWeâre also increasing our technology investments from 15% to 50%.â
These investments will help drive several customer-centric innovations, ranging from virtual try-ons to online product customisations.Â
The company also plans to expand its use of Salesforce.
Einstein Recommendations
will help teams use data on 60,000+ customers to personalise product recommendations. And
Salesforce Marketing Cloud
will help deepen customer engagement through data-driven digital marketing.Â
âIn the past two years, our ecommerce revenue has grown from 8% to 28%,â says Kapoor. âIn the next three years, we want it to touch 45%. Of that revenue, at least one-fourth should come from our website.âÂ
The company also wants to make customer journeys frictionless, not just on its website, but across its physical stores, online marketplaces, and other touchpoints.Â
âFor us, digitisation isnât just about building an online presence,â says Kapoor. âItâs about achieving a single, unified view of the customer across online and offline channels. So, when the customer walks into our store, we should be able to tell them, âThese are the items you left in your shopping cart online. Would you like to look at and purchase them, in-store?â Thatâs the kind of unified experience we want to deliver with Salesforce.â

Genpact builds a scalable ecosystem, powers digital transformation with Salesforce
Genpact is a global professional services firm with more than 100,000 employees working across 30 countries. The company partners with Fortune 500 enterprises across the globe in their digital transformation journeys.Â
âCompanies want to change the way they work, and we want to be the partner of choice for reimagining their businesses with digital,â says Deepak Shagrithaya, SVP Growth OperationsÂ
To underpin this critical role as a transformation partner, Genpact has paid great attention to its own digital transformation. Through the optimal use of technology, the company enables its distributed workforce to work as one, and anticipate and meet client needs rapidly. For Genpact, this is an ongoing journey.
âNow, we are transforming the Genpact environment so we can scale effortlessly, as we help our clients achieve transformation at scale ,â explains Vidya Rao, CIO, Genpact.
Searching for an extensible solution
Genpact began its digital transformation as an outcome of a blueprint exercise that laid out its strategic priorities. The company first looked at its sales process. Back then, Genpactâs existing enterprise CRM served more as a data repository, front-ended by multiple Excel sheets used by different business divisions. This led to an inconsistent sales process.Â
Management needed an automated solution that would bring all processes onto a single platform, provide real-time insights, and boost efficiency.
âWe were looking for a solution that would serve as a central nervous system to build out our digital ecosystem. Salesforce, with its AppExchange, plugins, and partnerships offered the vibrant ecosystem we needed to automate our sales processes end-to-end,â says Satyaswaroop Pradhan, Vice President, Business Transformation and Automation.
Building a data-driven sales and marketing engine with Salesforce
The guiding principles of the transformation were simple. Genpact wanted to provide salespeople with the deep insights they needed;, use digital capabilities to enable key components of different processes;, and create a single system to empower the sales team. This system would automate and simplify daily interactions and operations, so salespeople could function more efficiently.
To meet these objectives, Genpact used design thinking to create a set of integrated end-to-end enablement processes.Â  Salesforce Sales Cloud forms the backbone of this sales and marketing engine, successfully streamlining lead management.Â
The marketing automation platform pushes qualified leads into Sales Cloud, where salespeople have a unified view, and can take action with a single click. The inside sales team also runs its outreach campaigns using Salesforce Campaigns Management, and is able to effectively segment leads, ensure data privacy considerations and monitor campaign performance.Â
A sophisticated deal qualification system built on Salesforce scores and prioritises incoming opportunities. Predictive and actionable alerts help prioritisation, and as deals progress, salespeople can assess the probability of winning and get coached on areas of competitive advantage and vulnerability.
As the deal moves through its various stages, teams regularly update customer data and sales conversations in Salesforce. The number of customer conversations captured on the system saw a 50% jump within a year of solution implementation, pointing to widespread adoption.Â
With 100% of sales opportunities being captured on Salesforce, teams now have complete visibility into the global sales process, and a unified view of customers and their engagement history. With all this data at their fingertips, they are able to respond faster and more accurately to customer queries.
The data also feeds into dashboards that allow sales leaders to monitor deal progress, and analyse losses, understand trends and build sales forecasts.Â
âThese real-time insights are useful beyond the sales process,â observes Pradhan. âKnowing what clients are thinking at any point helps us set our strategic direction and informs our strategy.â
As it reaps the benefits of an automated sales function, Genpact has proceeded to transform other processes for greater optimisation.
Building company-wide digital innovation
âGoing beyond sales and marketing automation,â explains Shweta Gupta, Assistant Vice President, Salesforce CoE Lead, Genpact.Â âWe are now extending Salesforce usage for digital automation across other areas in HR and finance, and introducing end-to-end resource management, project management, and incentive management.âÂ
Genpact has leveraged the power of Salesforce Platform to build Pinnacle - a solution that automates project creation, and monitors deal compliance and billing. âWith Pinnacle, we are able to improve our resource cost management â so important for a services company,â points out Rao.Â
Talent Match, also built on Salesforce Platform, has automated and simplified the hiring journey, from demand creation to fulfilment. It is a resource management tool that provides timely demand estimates and supply visibility, and helps bridge any gaps.Â
Also, a variable incentive compensation tool built on Salesforce Platform is used for issuance of target letters, target assignment and faster pay-outs to the sales team. This has helped bring transparency and efficiency to the sales incentives process.
“
We have now started leveraging the power of Salesforce to meet more of our key business objectives across both customer and employee experience.”

Leveraging Salesforce for client transformation
Genpact has always maintained a deep understanding of the impact technology can have on achieving business objectives, and it uses that knowledge to help its own clients on their transformation journey. Genpact Cora is a proprietary digital business platform built specifically to help businesses accelerate their digital transformation.Â  Cora integrates Genpactâs 20+ years of operational expertise, best-in-class partner ecosystem, data-driven insights, and the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to transformÂ  operations and generate business impact.Â Â
Some of these digital offerings are built on Salesforce, which allows for seamless integration across infrastructure and client systems. Genpact works with clients to deliver customised solutions powered by the Cora platform, achieving greater business impact in a shorter amount of time, and ultimately improving the end-customer experience. The flexibility of the Cora digital business platform allows Genpactâs clients to gradually move away from legacy technologies and future-proof their processes in an increasingly digitised world.
Salesforce as a partner for long-term growth
With continuous investment in digital transformation, Genpact has seen its Salesforce partnership expand. Salesforce licence usage has grown 3x in the last five years.Â
Genpact also has a strong centre of excellence (CoE) that is the backbone of all its Salesforce activities. The CoE enables standardisation, repeatability, and a space for idea sharing on anything related to Salesforce.
Going forward, the team at Genpact will wield its considerable Salesforce expertise to boost collaboration, use data for deeper insights, and create innovative solutions to serve customers better.
âInitially, we were only tapping into the CRM functionality of Salesforce. But we have now started leveraging the power of Salesforce to meet more of our key business objectives across both customer and employee experience. Salesforce as a partner is here to stay,â sums up Rao.

CUSTOMER STORIES
A single platform for all student engagement allows FLAME University to create a personalised learning environment, and offer a smooth student experience.
FLAME Universityâs philosophy is rooted in the concept of liberal education. The university encourages students to interact with various disciplines to address world challenges so they can evolve into critical thinkers and lifelong learners. FLAME strives to create a personalised, participatory environment that provides a transformational student experience.
As part of this vision, FLAME invests heavily in future-ready technology to build highly customised student experiences.

State of the Connected Customer: Insights from 14,300 global consumers and business buyers on the trends shaping the future of customer engagement
âStudent satisfaction is at the core of our DNA. Salesforce gave us the platform to meaningfully capture student sentiment with ease.â
Mukesh Joshi
Director Technology - Information Systems, CTO (Integrator),
FLAME University
Future-proofing the university
Â The Information Systems team at FLAME was earlier limited by an underlying system that was neither easily customisable nor integrable. Also, it was slow to respond â resulting in frequent downtime.Â Â
âConventional, out-of-the-box, enterprise systems do not give you the capability to build and customise on the fly,â observes Mukesh Joshi, Director Technology - Information Systems, CTO (Integrator), FLAME University.Â
So, FLAME began looking for a highly customisable, reliable solution. To fulfil the vision of personalisation, it would have to be cloud-based, and offer scalability, efficiency, and integrability.Â
Salesforce emerged as the clear choice.

Technology enables accessibility and interconnectedness
With Salesforce, FLAME is now able to offer its stakeholders a frictionless experience. âWe no longer worry about maintenance, increased user load, and downtime. We use the freed-up time to build customisations quickly and easily, helped by Salesforceâs click-not-code functionality. So, we can provide our end-users with the best possible experiences,â says Joshi.Â Â
The first step in this journey was to improve collaboration and student engagement.
To this end, FLAME prioritised the building of a student community portal on
Salesforce Experience Cloud
. This portal has become the first touchpoint for prospective students looking to engage with the university, and current students seeking to connect with one another.
Prospective students can explore the programs offered and submit their applications here. The admissions team receives these and takes the process forward for smooth onboarding.
Current students, on the other hand, use the portal to collaborate on studies and projects. Students use
Chatter
to form focused groups, enabling speedy learning and project completion. Faculty members can also be invited to these groups as mentors, making the learning experience fruitful.
âWe no longer worry about maintenance, increased user load, and downtime. We use the freed-up time to build customisations quickly and easily, helped by Salesforceâs click-not-code functionality. So, we can provide our end-users with the best possible experiences.â
Mukesh Joshi
Director Technology - Information Systems, CTO (Integrator),
FLAME University
Streamlining the admissions funnel with Salesforce
Once FLAME built out a vibrant student experience, it focused on streamlining student lead management. Leads from the FLAME website, and from external partners such as career portals, educational portals, and marketing agencies are consolidated on
Sales Cloud
. A single view of these leads and prospective student data provides 360 visibility for better lead management. âThis has helped us build a better lead capture strategy, and respond quickly when a lead comes in,â explains Joshi.
A unified platform boosts service efficiency across the FLAME ecosystem
For a university that values stakeholder well-being, a seamless service experience is key. Students, faculty members, and non-faculty support teams such as Information Systems and administration can all raise cases using email, forms, and the community portal.
These cases all flow into
Salesforce Service Cloud
and are assigned to the relevant departments for resolution.Â  For example, the admissions office resolves cases raised by prospects, while studentsâ queries around subject and course choices are routed to the program office. With the solution functioning as a single service console for all departments and operations, cases to non-academic departments, such as the infirmary, facility maintenance, and travel desk, are also raised here.Â
âWith one collaborative service system, we are able to efficiently manage and resolve all stakeholder enquiries and student expectations,â says Joshi.
Leveraging the Salesforce ecosystem for process improvement and optimisation
FLAME is also thinking of ways to continuously optimise its processes and systems to boost efficiency and the stakeholder experience. âWe did not want to spend effort on these optimisations and felt that it would be ideal to find out-of-the-box solutions that could be deployed quickly and seamlessly within the Salesforce environment,â explains Joshi.Â
Sure enough, the team found apps to address its different needs on
Salesforce AppExchange
. Using Formstack, the team consolidated data from forms across the ecosystem; and streamlined workflows on Work-Relay. Booker25 helped automate the booking of classrooms and conference rooms. All these apps could be easily integrated with Salesforce, making it the single source of truth.
âWe wanted to have one system, one place for all interconnected data. And Salesforce delivered,â says Joshi.
âWe did not want to spend effort on these optimisations and felt that it would be ideal to find out-of-the-box solutions that could be deployed quickly and seamlessly within the Salesforce environment.â

360-degree engagement for contextual learner experience
FLAME now has a unified platform for 360-degree engagement with each student, which captures the studentâs entire journey with FLAME - from their first interaction to their latest grades, awards, and disciplinary concerns. Whenever a prospect or a student reaches out via any channel, the stakeholder uses the up-to-the-minute 360 view to respond in a sensitive, relevant manner.
âStudent satisfaction is the core of our DNA. Salesforce gave us the platform and tools to easily capture student sentiment and satisfaction,â observes Joshi.
A recent survey showed a high 90% student satisfaction rate with the technology available to them to engage with the university.

On the path to a best-in-class student system
The universityâs belief in leveraging top-notch technology has reaped dividends. With access to real-time reports and dashboards on Salesforce, senior leadership can now make speedy, data-backed decisions. FLAME is now adopting
Tableau
for data visualisation and analytics, to further underpin strategic thinking.Â
The university will also deploy
Salesforce Marketing Cloud
to improve lead acquisition and engagement. The insights will be used for better strategy and designing effective marketing campaigns on the right channels.
Eventually, FLAME plans to deploy
Salesforce Education Cloud
for a state-of-art Student Information System. âAll our engagements and interactions will be on this one system. That is the dream,â concludes Joshi.
