Investing at the Intersection of AI and the Energy Transition
Jul 5, 2024
Generative AI and its need for energy are straining power grids but may also offer solutions to managing energy demand. Investors and corporate leaders are assessing the sustainable innovations that could help to meet this challenge.
Key Takeaways
The clean energy transition and mass uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) are converging, creating potential investing opportunities.
Investors are assessing solutions that can address high energy demand and power grid reliability while reducing climate risks.
Sustainability innovations aim to tackle power transmission limitations, energy storage and greenhouse gas emissions.
The market for sustainability bonds has reached a new record, and new types of ESG-labeled debt include financing for nuclear energy projects.
Before
generative AI
became a focal point for most companies and investors, the clean energy transition was one of the most compelling and complex business opportunities in global markets. Now, the convergence of these transformative trends has posed a conundrum: On one hand, the massive energy requirements of AI data centers will cause a surge in power demand, adding to existing strains on the power grid; on the other hand, AI-driven solutions could potentially help to speed the energy transition.
As generative AI and the clean energy transition move toward an inflection point, Morgan Stanley’s 2024 Sustainable Finance Summit gathered corporate executives, sustainability leaders and institutional investors to discuss how capital markets, governments and technology can address these critical issues.
Lisa Shalett
, Chief Investment Officer, Wealth Management at Morgan Stanley, posed one version of a key question that was voiced repeatedly at the summit: “How are we going to digitize at the rate and pace that everyone thinks we should, without fundamentally upgrading the grid and power generation capacity around the world?”
To meet the ever-growing need for energy in a sustainable way in the coming years, there are three important areas to consider:
Continuing to advance clean energy goals without compromising access to power
Investing in sustainable innovations
Growing and evolving approaches to sustainable finance
1. Bridges to Renewable Energy and Solving Grid Reliability
Generative AI's power demands could skyrocket 70% annually, and by 2027, it may use as much energy as all of Spain needed in 2022, according to
Morgan Stanley Research
. In addition to AI, the rise of electric vehicles and the world’s standard electricity needs, such as heating and cooling, are set to heavily strain global power grids.
With proliferating energy demand, and the variable nature of renewables such as wind and solar, companies and investors are monitoring what mix of energy solutions may be required to fuel the world’s power needs. “There are debates about the messiness of the energy transition,” said Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley’s Global Head of Sustainability and Clean Tech Research. “For AI companies, reducing the time needed to get power is the most important commodity. And while most data centers will be clean-energy powered, not all will.”
Summit panelists shared the following trends related to the need for more green and consistent power:
Bridging “Dirty” and “Clean” Energy:
Natural gas may reduce dependence on more polluting fossil fuels while filling gaps in supply left by wind and solar power, in order to power consistent electricity. Using natural gas may be necessary for the next 30 years or more, some estimated.
Solving for Peak Demand Constraints:
A common problem worldwide is that during peak hours, power grids lack enough energy to meet demand. Companies and investors are assessing AI tools that could help utilities forecast energy spikes to adjust their distribution strategies, and battery storage systems that can set aside clean energy during off-peak hours and deploy it when demand is high.
Shifting to Energy-Efficient Systems:
Companies and consumers are adopting technologies that can reduce energy consumption, especially in heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Energy-efficient heat pumps that use electricity to transfer heat are replacing traditional setups that generate heat through the combustion of fossil fuels. For cooling, data centers are seeking heat-dissipation technologies, as AI chips produce more heat than their traditional counterparts.
Devising Government Incentives to Save Energy:
Government agencies in the U.S. and Europe are motivating consumers to transition to energy-efficient systems at scale. Some are offering incentives or subsidies for systems such as heat pumps or battery storage, while others initiated legislation that would ban fossil-fuel heating in homes.
2. Opportunities in Sustainability Innovations
Summit attendees agreed that the energy transition and provision of reliable power require the adoption of innovations that can scale with the help of capital markets. They highlighted the following emerging technologies and newer mechanisms that could have high impact:
Better Transmission Infrastructure:
To meet growing demands for clean electricity, governments will need to expand and upgrade the systems that deliver power over long distances. Currently, these transmission lines heat up when power runs through them, limiting their capacity. Technologies powered by AI are helping grid operators retrofit transmission lines with weather monitors to adjust the carrying capacity in real time during cooler weather, which maximizes the flow. Investors are assessing opportunities to invest in companies that facilitate these types of improvements in transmission infrastructure.
Batteries and Fuel Cells:
Lithium-ion batteries store and release energy, while fuel cells use hydrogen to generate electricity. Some see potential in these technologies to help improve power consistency, but challenges include batteries’ overheating and fire risk, and the high costs and lack of infrastructure for fuel cells.
Methane Offsets:
Scientists and policymakers increasingly recognize the importance of reducing methane emissions, which are responsible for about 30% of the current rise in global temperature
1
and are on track to exceed carbon dioxide emissions by a factor of approximately 30 in the next 20 years.
2
Compared to carbon offsets, methane-offset projects are newer and less widely adopted, and they focus on reducing and removing methane by combusting it into less harmful molecules—often around the sites of landfills or coal mines—or using the gas for purposes like heating water or generating electricity. As with assessing carbon offsets, methane-offset buyers are analyzing methodologies to determine whether methane reductions in projects are genuine and quantifiable.
3. Growth of Sustainable Financing and Green Bonds
The bond market for environmental, social and governance (ESG) projects reached a record in the first quarter of 2024,
3
as green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds added $272 billion in volume. “The growth of sustainability bonds is one of the mega secular trends that’s going to affect capital flows for the foreseeable future,” said
Melissa James
, Vice Chairman of
Global Capital Markets
at Morgan Stanley. “Investors are interested in the financial prospects of sustainability projects that align with their sustainable investing goals.”
In addition to highlighting the sustainability bond market’s growth, panelists spoke about new types of ESG-labeled debt that issuers and investors find interesting:
Nuclear Energy & Carbon Capture in Green Bonds:
“We’re starting to see some green bonds partly financing nuclear projects that extend the life and safe operations of existing nuclear assets, or help convert gas assets for carbon transport and storage,” said
Barbara Calvi
, EMEA Head of Fixed Income ESG Strategy & Research at
Morgan Stanley Investment Management
and
Calvert
. She highlighted the importance of evaluating the merits of new technologies and green financing on an ad hoc basis, to support investments that can credibly contribute to the energy transition.
Outcome Bonds:
The World Bank recently issued a new type of sustainability bond called an outcome bond, which finances sustainability projects but makes a portion of the return on the bond contingent on the success of those activities.
4
Different from other types of sustainability bonds, project performance risk is transferred to investors, who might forgo ordinary bond coupons to receive potentially higher coupons based on the success of the underlying sustainability projects. Outcome bonds are funding projects in wildlife conservation, emissions reductions and water purification.

Four Ways Tariffs Are Reshaping Markets
Mar 12, 2025
Discover what the Trump administration’s tariffs could mean for key equity sectors and how investors can navigate the risks and opportunities.
Author
Monica Guerra, Head of Policy, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
Author
Daniel Kohen, U.S. Policy Strategist, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
Key Takeaways
Stocks in sectors with high foreign revenue exposure, such as technology, materials and energy, may be especially vulnerable to tariff risks.
If tariffs are robust and long-lasting, defensive stocks in sectors such as health care and utilities may outperform cyclicals, such as consumer discretionary companies.
Investors may also want to favor certain services-oriented industries, such as software and cybersecurity, over goods-oriented companies.
As the Trump administration continues to implement its tariff agenda, global markets are feeling the effects, with sell-offs occurring as investors grapple with the implications of a rapidly evolving trade landscape. Understanding these changes is crucial for navigating the risks and opportunities.
Here are four things investors should know.
1
Stocks with exposure to countries facing tariffs have been hit harder.
The White House is simultaneously proposing and enacting sweeping, country-specific tariffs. Most notably, these include:
an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, adding to the 10% levy imposed in February and,
25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods, which Trump implemented and then partially retracted in early March, giving the countries a one-month reprieve.
We can see the market impact of country-specific tariffs when reviewing the Morgan Stanley Institutional Equity Division Tariff Risk Index, a basket of stocks with high sensitivity to increased tariffs on China and Mexico. As of March 6, relative to the S&P 500 Index, China and Mexico tariff-exposed stocks had sold off about 22% and 10%, respectively, since March 2024 and had declined by 12% and 10%, respectively, since Trump took office in January 2025.
2
The U.S. technology, materials and energy sectors look especially vulnerable, while utilities and health care may prove resilient.
The technology, materials, energy and industrials sectors, with foreign revenue exposure as high as 57%, are particularly exposed to tariffs. For example, recent tariffs targeting aluminum and steel could place a drag on the materials sector, and China-specific tariffs or retaliation efforts could have secondary impacts for tech. Should the tariff regime escalate further, Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Office expects the utilities and health care sectors to outperform due to their defensive nature and low tariff exposure.
Markets are likely to quickly price tariff-related risks to a particular sector, industry or stock. Steel and solar products offer a compelling illustration: In January 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines of 30% to 50%. In March 2018, he imposed tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminum from most countries. Following these measures, industries impacted by the tariffs underperformed: Both the MAC Global Solar Energy Index and the NYSE Arca Steel Index declined by more than 11% in the first six months following the tariffs’ enactment. In February 2025, Trump announced additional tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum. While the tariffs are expected to go into effect in March 2025, the NYSE Arca Steel Index has already declined roughly 5% and has been volatile since the president’s announcement.
1
3
Defensive stocks may outperform cyclicals.
If a robust and long-lasting universal tariff regime comes to fruition, defensive U.S. stocks, such as those in utilities, health care or consumer staples, may outperform cyclical sectors like industrials or consumer discretionary, which may be more vulnerable to increased import costs and reduced international trade. In such an environment, stock-picking becomes more prudent. Among consumer discretionary stocks, for example, investors could see increased variability in returns between companies with stronger pricing power and the ability to absorb tariffs, and those without. Additionally, consumer discretionary companies with greater reliance on revenues generated from lower-income consumers will likely experience the most pressure, as higher prices weigh more heavily on the purchasing power of those with less to spend. On the other hand, if some tariff risks are avoided and prove mostly benign, cyclicals may outperform defensives.
4
U.S. services industries may fare better than goods producers.
Areas such as software, cybersecurity,
defense tech
and large-cap financials, some of which have lower foreign revenue exposure, are less likely to feel the impact of tariffs; they may benefit in tandem from the momentum behind AI adoption. Furthermore, utilities have low tariff exposure and may serve as a defensive leader should broad-based tariffs increase market pressure.
What Could Come Next
Promoting U.S. industry protectionism and prioritizing national security are likely to remain two of the most steadfast drivers for the use of tariffs in foreign policy. This means that select tariffs on global goods, and specific countries, like China, are likely to increase before they decline, and perhaps last longer. By contrast, further tariffs on allies and U.S. trade partners with deeply integrated supply chains, such as Mexico and Canada, may be avoided through concessions.

Index Definitions

Risk Considerations
Equity securities
may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.
Investing in foreign markets
entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks.
Investing in currency
involves additional special risks such as credit, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investment risk, and domestic and foreign inflation rates, which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. In addition, international investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with
emerging markets and frontier markets
, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.
Growth investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.
Value investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.
Because of their narrow focus,
sector investments
tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.
Technology stocks
may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the
energy and natural resources
sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk.
Health care sector stocks
are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) investments
in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.
The
indices
are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index. They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. The indices are not subject to expenses or fees and are often comprised of securities and other investment instruments the liquidity of which is not restricted. A particular investment product may consist of securities significantly different than those in any index referred to herein. Comparing an investment to a particular index may be of limited use.
The
indices selected by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
to measure performance are representative of broad asset classes. Morgan Stanley Wealth Management retains the right to change representative indices at any time.
Performance of indices
may be more or less volatile than any investment product. The risk of loss in value of a specific investment (such as with an investment manager or in a fund) is not the same as the risk of loss in a broad market index. Therefore, the historical returns of an index will not be the same as the historical returns of a particular investment product.

The History of Morgan Stanley
For 89 years, Morgan Stanley has worked to meet the financial needs of its clients, from individuals and families to institutions and corporations. With a history of innovation and a passion for cutting-edge ideas, Morgan Stanley has  established itself as a global leader in the financial services industry, always evolving to serve our clients and our communities.
Share This
Introduction
Founded in 1935 as a partnership with a staff of just 13, Morgan Stanley is now a global financial services firm operating in more than 40 countries with over 80,000 employees. Through our integrated businesses—Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management—we offer our clients keen insights, forward-thinking strategies, innovative products and experience-based advice to help them meet their goals.
Our History at a Glance
1935 -
1959
The First 25 Years
Morgan Stanley
opened for business on September 16, 1935
, as a partnership with a staff of 13. In its first year, the firm handled $1.1 billion in public offerings and private placements—representing a 24% market share.
Over the next decade the firm played a key role in many significant transactions, including the distribution in 1938 of $100 million of debentures for the
United States Steel
Corporation
as lead underwriter. In 1939, we were the lead syndicate for U.S. rail financing.
In 1941, Morgan Stanley liquidated its stock and reorganized to qualify for
membership on the New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE), which it joined in 1942.
The early 1940s saw the start of the firm's commitment to giving back, when founder
Harold
Stanley raised $1.5 million for the U.S. Committee for the Care of European Children
.
In 1947, the firm issued the first bond on behalf of the World Bank to fund post-war reconstruction in Europe.
During the 1950s, the firm
managed General Motors' $300 million debt issuance
--at the time, the largest securities issue ever underwritten. Other major deals during this period included a
$231 million
IBM stock offering
and
a $250 million debt offering for AT&T.
Leadership:
Harold Stanley, President, 1935–1951; Henry Morgan, Secretary and Treasurer, 1935-1970; Perry Hall, President, 1951–1961
1960 -
1979
Global and Business Expansion
In the 1960s, Morgan Stanley developed the f
irst computer model to deal with the increasing complexity of financial analysis.
Morgan Stanley opened its
first international office i
n 1967, launching Morgan & Cie. International in Paris with Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., to pursue the growing European securities market.
In 1970, Morgan Stanley was among the first global investment banks to establish a presence in
Japan
.
Between 1972 and 1977, the firm launched its
Sales and Trading
,
Research
,
Investment Management
, Real Estate and
Private Wealth Management
businesses.
Morgan Stanley moved its international office
from Paris to London
in 1977.
Leadership:
Samuel Payne, President, 1970–1971; Chester Lasell, President, 1971–1972; Frank Petito, Chairman, 1973–1979; Robert H. Baldwin, President, 1973–1979, Chairman, 1979–1983
1980 -
2006
Creating the Modern Morgan Stanley
In 1984, Morgan Stanley developed the first
Trade Analysis Processing System (
TAPS), which boosted the volume of accuracy of trades, and formed its
Prime Brokerage
group to service hedge fund clients.
In 1985, Morgan Stanley launched its
Fixed Income Division.
In 1986, the firm established Morgan Stanley and Co. International Plc, a financial services company
operating in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, the Americas and Asia.
Over the course of the next few decades, the firm opened offices in Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Melbourne, Milan, São Paulo, Sydney and Zurich, as well as expanding in London and Tokyo.
(View our Global Offices.)
Morgan Stanley created its
analytical proprietary trading group
in 1986, bringing together traders, technical analysts and computer engineers to create and deploy new trading technologies.
Morgan Stanley
became a public company
in 1986.
The firm launched the MSCI World Index in 1988,
the first comprehensive index of equity markets in developing countries.
The
Richard B. Fisher Scholarship
was founded in 1993 to attract candidates from historically underrepresented groups to the financial industry.
In 1995, Morgan Stanley moved its global headquarters to its current location at 1585 Broadway in New York.
Morgan Stanley and
Dean Witter merged
in 1997, creating America's largest asset management company and securities firm in terms of equity capital. The resulting name, Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover & Company, was shortened to Morgan Stanley in March 2001.
In 2000, the first Global Information Center (GIC) opened in Glasgow, now one of
nine Global Centers
. Their initial remit, providing trade settlements, has grown to include research, data analysis, risk management and technological innovation in areas such as artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.
On
September 11, 2001
, Morgan Stanley had offices in the South Tower of the World Trade Center. Rick Rescorla, our vice president of security, led a massive evacuation of our 2,700 employees. Rick perished in the building along with 12 of our colleagues. For his bravery, Rick was posthumously awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2019.
The New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital
opened in 2003, creating a world-class facility for pediatric care.

2007 -
2009
Reemerging from the Financial Crisis
After the 2008 stock market crash, Morgan Stanley and seven other large U.S. banks received capital investments through the
Troubled Asset Relief Program
(TARP). By June 2009,
Morgan Stanley had fully paid back
the $10 billion in TARP money to the U.S. Treasury.
In 2008, Morgan Stanley
became a financial holding company
under the Bank Holding Company Act. That same year, it formed a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG).
In 2009, Morgan Stanley established a new broker-dealer that combined Morgan Stanley's Global Wealth Management Group with Citi's Smith Barney in the U.S., Quilter in the UK and Smith Barney Australia retail units into a new wealth management firm. It operated as
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
and became the largest wealth management business in the world.
Leadership:
John J. Mack, Chairman and CEO, 2005–2009; James P. Gorman, Co–President, 2007–2010
2010 -
2024
Innovation and Strategic Acquisitions
In 2012, Morgan Stanley launched the first-of-its-kind
Investing with Impact Platform
, which enabled clients to align their portfolios with environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals.
The firm established the
Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing
in 2013
to create scalable, sustainable investing solutions.
In 2013, Morgan Stanley bought Citigroup’s final 35 percent stake of the wealth management joint venture, since renamed
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
.
Our Multicultural Client Strategy Group, founded in 2017 (and renamed the
Inclusive Ventures Group
in 2023), promotes financial inclusion and provides women and diverse entrepreneurs with access to capital and other business-critical resources.
In 2019, Morgan Stanley agreed to acquire
Solium Capital
Inc., a leading global provider of software-as-a-service (SaaS) for equity administration, financial reporting and compliance. The acquisition paved the way for the firm to launch
Morgan Stanley at Work
.
The 2020 all-stock transaction of
E*TRADE
,
valued at approximately $13 billion, allowed Morgan Stanley to complement its full-service, advisor-driven Wealth Management business with E*TRADE’s direct-to-consumer and digital capabilities.
The firm launched its
Institute for Inclusion

MSIM refers to the investment management business segment of Morgan Stanley. MSIM is composed of a number of wholly owned subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley. Certain subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley in its investment management business, including, but not limited to, Calvert Research and Management and Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC, may differ in their approach to sustainable investing. Accordingly, the discussion of sustainable investing described herein may not be applicable to each Morgan Stanley affiliate or investment team. Further, some investment strategies may not consider ESG factors where it is not currently feasible or appropriate to do so, e.g., passive investment strategies, certain asset allocation strategies or where requested by clients.

The firm’s carbon neutral status reflects the actions in the firm’s 2023 ESG Report, page 47. For any given year the determination of carbon neutrality is based on the best available data at the time of such determination. This data and related methodologies are evolving and improving so that information for prior periods is subject to change and revision. Carbon neutral status is a management-determined metric that may be viewed or calculated differently by others who may use the same “carbon neutral” terminology. Morgan Stanley has determined that the boundary around our carbon neutrality status is scope 1, scope 2 location-based emissions, scope 3 business travel and downstream leased assets, carbon offsets purchased from the voluntary carbon market, green power contracts, and market instruments (e.g., renewable energy certificates (RECs), energy attribute certificates (EACs)). There are instances where green power contracts and instruments that we accept for our purposes to meet carbon neutrality do not align with the criteria required to reflect those purchases in our scope 2 market-based figure in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) (“GHG Protocol”). For our GHG emissions table aligned with the GHG protocol, please see the Operational Emissions section of the 2023 ESG Report.

This AUM figure includes funds and mandates with at least one of the following sustainability features: 1. impact objectives, 2. sustainability theme objectives, 3. tilts based on sustainability factors, 4. low-carbon or net-zero commitments. Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC AUM is not currently included in this figure.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Certain statements herein, including expectations related to targets, goals, aspirations or objectives such as financed emissions targets, including interim targets, commitments, representation objectives and the achievement thereof, may be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results or actions may differ from anticipated goals, approaches and targets set forth in the forward-looking statements. These statements are not historical facts or statements of current conditions, but instead are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. These statements are not guarantees of future results or occurrences and involve certain known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict and are often beyond our control. In addition, this website contains statements based on hypothetical scenarios and assumptions, which may not occur or differ significantly from actual events, and these statements should not necessarily be viewed as being representative of current or actual risk or forecasts of expected risk.
Actual results and financial conditions may differ materially from those included in these statements due to a variety of factors, including, among others, data quality and availability,
global socio-demographic, political and economic conditions and trends; energy prices; technological innovations; climate-related conditions and weather events; counterparty and client behavior and financial health; the evolution of consumer behavior; insurance applicability, legislative and regulatory changes; the need for thoughtful climate policies, the challenge of balancing short-term targets with the need to facilitate an orderly transition and energy security, our ability to retain and attract qualified employees in a competitive environment for talent; the potential impact of legal and regulatory obligations; and other unforeseen events or conditions, and the precautionary statements included on this website and those contained in Morgan Stanley’s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). Certain forward-looking statements included on this website are also based on assumptions, standards, metrics, methodologies and frameworks for measurement, reporting and analysis of climate change that continue to evolve, vary across jurisdictions and regulatory bodies and are the subject of proposed regulatory changes in multiple jurisdictions, which may have a material impact on our future measurement and reporting, as well as the results of Morgan Stanley’s efforts. Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Morgan Stanley speak only as to the date they are made, and Morgan Stanley does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements were made.
MATERIALITY
The disclosures included here are being provided to the public in an effort to provide transparency into our ESG initiatives and to further enhance our collective understanding of ESG issues. Our approaches to the disclosures included on this website differ in significant ways from those included in mandatory regulatory reporting, including under SEC rules and regulations.
Information on this website may be presented from a different perspective or in more detail than disclosures mandated by our global regulators. In particular, while the foregoing discussion describes potential future events that may be significant or material (based on disclosure recommendations and broader definitions of materiality used by certain voluntary external frameworks and reporting guidelines or those in non-U.S. jurisdictions), the significance or materiality of those potential events should not be read as equating to or arising to the level of materiality as required under U.S. federal securities laws, including as the concept is used in Morgan Stanley’s periodic filings with the SEC under the Exchange Act. In addition, any discussion of forward-looking statements on these webpages is not an indication that the subject or information is material to Morgan Stanley for U.S. federal securities laws and regulations reporting purposes. We continue to monitor the climate disclosure landscape and evolve our reporting accordingly.

Outlooks
Stock Market Outlook 2025: Can the Bull Run Persist?
Feb 19, 2025
After two strong years for stocks, more muted gains are likely in 2025, with opportunities in U.S. stocks, growth and value.
Andrew Slimmon
Head of Applied Equity Advisors Team, Morgan Stanley Investment Management
Key Takeaways
Following two strong years, further stock market gains are likely in 2025 but may be more muted.
Continued adoption of artificial intelligence could lead to a productivity boom, as in the late 90’s.
In terms of investment region and style, investors can consider U.S. equities and both value and growth stocks among areas of opportunity in 2025.
Investors should watch for signs of market euphoria, including sustained retail stock purchases and aggressively positive net fund flows near 2021 levels.
Can the bull run in equity markets persist for a third year in 2025? Returns for the S&P 500 Index have topped 25% for two years in a row, creating concerns about whether stocks are overvalued. Historically, however, while the third year of a bull market produces only a mediocre return on average, it is typically not negative.
1
There could be a scenario in which 2025 earnings-per-share growth exceeds market returns, pulling the market's overall price-earnings valuation down. With enough negatives out there, including higher-for-longer interest rates and geopolitical noise, to cause a subpar year, the recently minted optimists could revert to being skeptics, only to have the market roar again in 2026. In that case, 2025 could be more of a pause year than anything more sinister.
Watch Investors’ Behavior
Investor behavior over the past several years looks a lot like it has in previous bull markets, and following such patterns can be one of the most consistent ways to nurture portfolio outperformance. While investors may act irrationally at times, their irrationality is usually consistent. The famed investor Sir John Templeton captured the idea that investor psychology plays a large role in market cycles in this 1966 quote: “Bull markets are born on pessimism, grow on skepticism, mature on optimism, and die on euphoria.” In the current cycle, investors have moved through the first two stages of a bull market just as Templeton would have expected:
Pessimism
was certainly a feature of the first year of the current bull market (beginning following the bear market drawdown at the end of September 2022). Consistent with historic patterns, retail investors were net sellers, and Wall Street strategists began 2023 forecasting a 4% gain for the S&P 500—a significant undershoot.
Skepticism
reigned in the second year of the bull market, keeping retail investors from adding significantly to their equity portfolios even as stocks soared; strategists continued to forecast only tiny gains.
Optimism
emerged as 2024 ended and the bull market entered its third year, with retail fund flows finally turning more strongly positive and Wall Street prognosticators adjusting their forecasts to become bullish about 2025, implying double-digit gains.
The Potential Impact of AI
The third year after a 25% or more market decline—which is where the market stands now—tends to produce a positive, but muted return. However, what has the potential to lead to a longer or stronger stock market rally is a huge commercial embrace of artificial intelligence and resulting productivity boom, similar to what happened with the Internet in the late 1990s. This alternative scenario is bolstered by the inauguration of a new President who, through significant investment, clearly intends to ensure the U.S. remains the AI leader. Some historical data to consider:
While two back-to-back 20%+ return years have tended to produce a lackluster third year, the late 1990s were an exception.
After two great 20% years in 1995 and 1996, there was no pause. Instead, the S&P 500 roared higher in 1997 (+33%), 1998 (+29%) and 1999 (+21%).
2
To be clear, I am not suggesting a 67% return for the S&P 500 over the next three years. It remains to be seen how the broader application of AI technologies within corporations will affect their bottom lines. But the Law of Accelerating Returns demonstrates the tendency for technological advances to feed on themselves, increasing the rate of further advance, and pushing well past what one might sensibly project by linear extrapolation of current progress.
3
The embrace of AI could ultimately enhance margins and profitability for a broad swath of companies in many different industries.
U.S. Stocks, Growth and Value
In terms of investment styles and regions, these themes stand out for stock opportunities in 2025.
Growth and value stocks:
Currently, big tech is heavily owned individually and within the indices. This ultimately can result in big swoons when news, such as the introduction of a Chinese large language model, comes out like it did in the last week of January. However, I wouldn't actively bet against the major tech companies that comprise the biggest weights in the S&P 500. When the dotcom bubble peaked in 2000, the big titans of that era traded at 50-75x forward price-to-earnings ratios. Today, most of the mega-caps trade at roughly a 50% discount to these previous peak multiples.
4
Additionally, investors should consider more than simply growth equities, especially financials. Combined with industrials, we currently favor a balance between growth and value stocks.
U.S. stocks:
I often hear the comment, “the rest of the world is cheaper,” implying that investors should seek opportunities outside the U.S. Broadly speaking, however, stocks that have the level of profitability and growth commensurate with those in the U.S. are not cheaper. Rather, there are simply many less-profitable companies outside the U.S than inside the U.S. Therefore, rather than taking strong regional non-U.S. bets, we actively seek stock-specific opportunities outside the U.S. representing companies we want to own.
Watch for Investor Euphoria
Investors should become cautious when the market reaches the euphoria state, but it does not seem to be near that point yet. One indicator would be sustained
stock purchases by individual investors, thus meriting caution. So far, while net fund flows have ticked higher than the first two early-stage bull market years, they are not near levels seen for all of 2021. In the last six months of 2024, net fund flows totaled less than $100 billion, versus $1.2 trillion net flows in 2021, which was the last time there were clear signs of exuberance. Ultimately, the Fed could help determine how quickly this bull market runs its course. If policymakers cut rates more slowly, it could extend the optimism phase. More aggressive easing could help tip the market into euphoria.

Risk Considerations
Diversification does not eliminate the risk of loss. There is no assurance that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective. Portfolios are subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the portfolio will decline and may therefore be less that what you paid for them. Market values can change daily due to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises, terrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries, companies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and potential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this portfolio may be subject to certain additional risks.In general, equities securities’ values also fluctuate in response to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small- and medium-capitalization companies entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more established companies. Investments in foreign markets entail special risks such as currency, political, economic, market and liquidity risks. Illiquid securities may be more difficult to sell and value than publicly traded securities (liquidity risks). Non-diversified portfolios often invest in a more limited number of issuers. As such, changes in the financial condition or market value of a single issuer may cause greater volatility.

2025 M&A Outlook: 4 Trends Driving an Anticipated Rebound

A favorable regulatory environment and almost $3 trillion in uncommitted capital are among key factors that could lead to a comeback for mergers and acquisitions.
Key Takeaways
A more favorable regulatory environment for M&A activity and stronger capital markets may spur deal making and a more robust rebound in 2025.
Financial sponsor activity is poised to increase, especially on the sell side, and activity in take-private transactions will likely continue.
Activists may continue pushing for changes at companies through M&A and corporate separations.
Notwithstanding the new U.S. administration’s tariff policies, there is interest across global regions in cross-border transactions as economies have grown at different paces, resulting in some attractive valuations and appetite for diversification.
Certain policies from the new U.S. administration might hinder M&A growth—at least in the short term—but overall the positives should outweigh the negatives.
The rebound in mergers and acquisitions that did not fully materialize in 2024 appears to be on track for 2025. Although mergers and acquisitions increased in 2024 after hitting a low point in 2023, deal volume was lower than expected after private-equity firms delayed selling assets and a challenging regulatory environment hindered the largest deals valued over $40 billion.
Now, however, slower areas of the M&A market such as private equity monetizations, strategic deals and cross-border transactions are now poised for growth: A new U.S. presidential administration could usher in relaxed antitrust and merger guidelines, facilitating deals. At the same time, financial sponsors may consider finally selling the companies or stakes in companies that they acquired in previous years, returning money to investors from funds nearing the end of their lives in order to raise new funds.
Two key drivers will be increased activity from financial sponsors selling companies and a more favorable antitrust environment.

“We have a positive view of the M&A market for 2025,” says Tom Miles, Co-Global Head of M&A at Morgan Stanley. “Two key drivers will be increased activity from financial sponsors selling companies and a more favorable antitrust environment. On sponsors, the average age of sponsor portfolios is historically high and monetizations have to happen to allow for new fundraising. On antitrust, the expectation is that we return to a more traditional and predictable review process and that should spur more activity as companies have more predictable outcomes and timelines.”
Deregulation, increased financial sponsor activity and appetite from well-capitalized companies could spur deal making. However, the impact of the President-Elect Donald Trump administration’s impending tariff and immigration policies is unclear: “These are unknowns that could delay consolidation trends in certain sectors in the short to medium term,” Miles says.
As companies and investors seek clarity on the strength of an M&A rebound in the year ahead, Morgan Stanley’s M&A bankers highlight four key deal-making trends to watch in 2025.
1. Financial Sponsors Reemerge
Muted M&A levels in the past three years, driven by higher interest rates that led to increased borrowing costs and lower corporate valuations, resulted in financial sponsors delaying exits, which has resulted in pent-up supply. In addition to private equity and venture capital’s $2.6 trillion in uncommitted capital as of July 2024,
1
there is an ever-increasing inventory of aging private-equity owned assets that need to be monetized.
Number of Private-Equity Portfolio Companies
Source: Pitchbook as of September 30, 2024.
About half of private-equity portfolio companies are more than five years old, and close to 30% are seven years old or more.
However, financial sponsors have been very active on the buy side, notably through take-private transactions. According to Miles, 2024 marks a banner year for the value of take-private transactions, which reached more than $200 billion.

“Financial sponsors have had a lot of capital and wanted to deploy it, and public companies have been more willing sellers,” Miles says. A public company returning to private ownership has an opportunity to grow and improve its prospects without the pressure of delivering quarterly returns to public shareholders.

For the M&A market to experience a robust rebound in 2025, financial-sponsor activity will need to pick up beyond take-privates. Pressure keeps building for private-equity firms to sell assets and return money to investors; they will need to monetize their assets and return capital to stakeholders as a first step before raising new funds. “Pressure will keep growing and get to point where sponsors will sell,” Miles says.
2. Companies Deploy Their Capital
The more favorable antitrust and regulatory environment expected under the incoming presidential administration may lead to a resurgence in strategic activity in 2025 for deals of all sizes, especially for mega-deals that were hindered by increased regulatory scrutiny during President Biden’s administration, says John Collins, Co-Global Head of M&A at Morgan Stanley. However, uncertainties remain about the incoming U.S. presidential administration’s tariff and immigration policies, he says.
These unknown macroeconomic factors will play an important role in whether buyers and sellers can reach agreement on valuation. “In 2024, a lot of buyers couldn’t underwrite the growth trajectory that sellers were expecting,” Collins says. “While some sectors may be more affected than others by the policies, we still expect that the overall market will benefit from the more favorable regulatory environment, and that corporates with robust balance sheets will pursue capital deployment through M&A.”
The financial sector is likely to see the most regulatory relief, according to John Esposito, Head of Global Financial Institutions at Morgan Stanley. “Easing capital requirements and antitrust laws could spur a lot of bank and insurance consolidation, as well as other M&A activity,” he says.
3. Shareholder Activists Spur Change
Shareholder activism has continued to increase for companies of all sizes in 2024. Part of the growth is coming from top-tier activists targeting large- and mega-cap companies, as activists continued to aggressively pursue board representation. A stronger M&A environment, in which companies can find buyers more easily, should continue to encourage more activist investors to push for changes at undervalued companies, notably through corporate separations.
“Activists may go more aggressively after corporate separations, pushing companies to ‘shrink to grow’ and unlock valuation for shareholders,” says Michael Kagan, Head of Separations and Structured Solutions at Morgan Stanley. “Post-pandemic, there’s been a significant gap between companies with strong and poor operating performance. Companies at the lower end of the curve will be targets.”
4. Cross-Border M&A Continues
In the last five years, the U.S. economy has grown more strongly than economies in Europe and the U.K., which may spur European companies to acquire U.S. companies, to gain exposure to the U.S. market. The U.S. had the highest GDP growth (11.4%) among G7 economies from the fourth quarter of 2019 through the third quarter of 2024, which compared to Eurozone GDP’s 4.6% rise and UK GDP’s 3% gain during the same period.

“The U.S. has performed consistently better economically, in terms of growth, profit margin and resilience,” says Jan Weber, Head of EMEA M&A at Morgan Stanley.
There’s a financial arbitrage that U.S. companies may find attractive. They may buy into Europe and be tactical about what capabilities they want to acquire.

On the flip side, U.S. companies may look to acquire European companies to strategically expand their footprint and take advantage of the structurally lower valuations of European companies. “There’s a financial arbitrage that U.S. companies may find attractive. They may buy into Europe and be tactical about what capabilities they want to acquire.”
Other regions have also been active, in particular Japan, which introduced a draft of new takeover guidelines in 2023 to promote desirable M&A transactions and shareholder transparency.

Companies are signaling interest in assets, both domestically and overseas. “Japan has been very active this year and has great momentum, in part driven by the changing regulatory environment,” Weber says. “Japanese companies may also buy into Europe for diversification.”

A Watershed Moment for AI
Feb 25, 2025
DeepSeek’s announcement that it has developed an AI model at a fraction of competitors’ costs has had ripple effects through the tech industry and beyond. Here are five areas for investors to watch.
Key Takeaways
The introduction of a new low-cost AI model has bifurcated the market into a premium segment of companies willing to pay to be AI leaders and a low-cost segment with AI models converging and commoditizing.
Despite fresh scrutiny over AI investments, major tech players are sticking to their aggressive spending plans.
China’s support of AI development may lead governments around the world to consider changes in technology policy.
January 27, 2025, marked a watershed date for the tech world.
That was when DeepSeek, a relatively new Chinese startup, announced that it was able to develop an AI model at a fraction of the cost relative to estimates of major players in the industry.
DeepSeek said it spent only $5.6 million to power an AI model with capabilities similar to those of products developed by more famous rivals. It was a marked contrast to the major companies in the tech world that had been planning investments of hundreds of millions, if not billions, on their own AI models.
“Driving new cost efficiencies and innovation is important in any tech cycle,” says Morgan Stanley’s U.S. Internet analyst Brian Nowak. “The market’s strong reaction to the news was based on the fact that this breakthrough came from a company out of China that a lot of people didn’t know about. But it’s actually a good sign for the next three to five years of the Gen AI cycle.”
Since then, DeepSeek has begun rapidly integrating into multiple enterprises and sectors, such as data centers and telecom. Companies in industries such as automotive and financial services have adopted these advancements as well. It is also seeing accelerated adoption by consumers, given its very low cost and users’ ability to download a simple version of the model in PCs and smartphones.
Morgan Stanley Research analysts are watching the most significant shifts following the DeepSeek breakthrough, the potential overreactions and, most important, the opportunities that can arise from that event.
1. The AI Market Is Splitting
Shawn Kim, who heads the Asia Technology research team for Morgan Stanley Research, says it’s no longer the case that only a few companies would be able to afford powerful chips and heavy infrastructure to efficiently develop AI.
“The AI market appears increasingly bifurcated,” Kim says. “One segment remains a premium for entities willing to pay substantially to be the first, but for the rest, AI is a cost center, and everyone wants cheaper tokens.”
The premium segment, he notes, is focused on using data and supercomputers that would lead to existential developments, such as the replacement of workers by AI. By contrast
,
the low-cost AI market, which became more visible after DeepSeek’s announcement, features affordable entry costs, with AI models converging and commoditizing very quickly. That’s good news for the consumers of AI, but it is going to be more difficult for AI providers to make money in that segment.
Kim notes there’s also a third possibility in this new AI economic structure: a market in which large tech companies will likely offer AI for free so that people stay on their platforms longer.
2.
Investors
Question AI Spending
Given the progress that DeepSeek made with a relatively low budget, investors are scrutinizing companies’ AI investments, while corporate leaders question whether it’s really necessary to spend billions of dollars to reach their AI goals.
But recent earnings reports and calls show that, so far, the major tech companies are sticking to their aggressive plans for capital expenditures (CapEx).
For Stephen Byrd, Morgan Stanley’s Head of Research Product for the Americas & Head of Global Sustainability Research, DeepSeek hasn’t changed the view on AI infrastructure growth. He expects announcements of big data centers and training facilities to keep coming, especially because the demand for AI is expected to increase.
“There has been steady progress in terms of efficiencies, and DeepSeek represents an improvement in that regard,” Byrd says. “This happens in every technology revolution: We see continuing cost reductions and then dramatic increases in demand for the product.”
Before the DeepSeek event, a Morgan Stanley Research survey of chief information officers showed an uptick in IT budget growth expectations for 2025. The survey, conducted between October and December, pointed to AI/machine learning as the main priority for CIOs.
3. AI Drives Clean Energy Demand
As analysts expect companies to maintain CapEx plans for AI infrastructure, that infrastructure will have enormous energy needs—and Morgan Stanley Research still expects that demand to drive investments in clean energy.
Andrew Percoco, Head of North America Clean Tech at Morgan Stanley, says the outlook for power demand associated with AI in the U.S. hasn’t changed as a result of the DeepSeek announcement. He notes there is still a strong need to develop more renewables, including solar and wind, to power AI data centers.
“Overall, it was a scary moment in the market for the AI narrative,” Percoco says. “But I think investors have found it as an opportunity to re-engage in some of these stories.”
Byrd says multiple different sources of energy, such as nuclear and natural gas, will continue to be in demand to power AI data centers.
“When you look at the magnitude of power needs, we’re going to see everything from tiny 20 MW projects to multi-thousand MW data-center projects. We still believe that nuclear very much fits the purpose,” Byrd says. “We do expect to see quite a few announcements of data centers that can be linked to natural gas, as well as nuclear deals and bitcoin-conversion deals.”
4. Humanoids Advance in China
An important lesson from the DeepSeek event is that China is moving very aggressively in data collection. Among other impacts, this will boost its development of
humanoid robots
– AI “brains” trained on vast sets of real and simulated robotic data to help them understand natural language, learn from and imitate human action, and perceive their dynamic environments.
Morgan Stanley’s research suggests China continues to show the most impressive progress in humanoid robotics, with startups benefitting from established supply chains, local adoption opportunities and strong support from the national government.
Electric vehicles with autonomous capabilities, which require similar technologies as humanoids, are also evolving quickly in China. “If you can solve autonomous cars, you can solve autonomous anything, whether it’s drones, aviation, humanoids and everything else in between,” says Adam Jonas, Head of Global Autos & Shared Mobility Research.
5. Governments Weight Action
The DeepSeek event was also a wake-up call for Western nations.
“Some investors think, rather dismissively, that the Western world will dominate all aspects of AI because it has access to superior computing, and China does not,” Jonas says. “DeepSeek is a symbol of what can be done when a centrally planned government puts very high priority on achieving dominance or leadership in rapidly moving AI-enabled technologies.”
Jonas notes that it’s important to watch very closely what China is doing on the AI front because it affects not just U.S. tech companies’ ability to compete, but even more importantly, government policies that can be supportive of the private sector.

GenAI Revenue Could Surpass $1 Trillion by 2028
Mar 4, 2025
Software and Internet companies are likely to see their revenue from Generative AI rise more than 20-fold over the next three years, with a positive return on investment as soon as 2025.
Key Takeaways
Revenue from GenAI could reach about $1.1 trillion in 2028, a jump from $45 billion in 2024.
As mainstream adoption accelerates, GenAI is expected to start generating profits in 2025, with an estimated margin of 34%.
GenAI semiconductor spending forecasted to reach $280 billion in 2028 is well supported by this level of GenAI returns.
Spending on hardware, networking and memory for GenAI is likely to almost triple to $276 billion in 2028, from $98 billion in 2024.
Revenue from generative AI is likely to increase more than 20-fold over the next three years, with software and internet companies expected to see a positive return on their AI investments as soon as this year, as the expanding functionality of GenAI prompts broader use and triggers a new technology cycle.
After an unprecedented level of investment, GenAI could drive potential revenue of about $1.1 trillion in 2028, up from $45 billion in 2024, according to Morgan Stanley Research.
“Now that we've had GenAI products in the marketplace for more than a year and they've proved their efficacy, the market is going to be ready to start adopting these solutions,”
says Keith Weiss, who leads Morgan Stanley’s U.S. Software Research.
“That's when revenue starts to flow to the software companies that are trying to automate business processes.”
AI Becomes Mainstream
GenAI caught the general public's attention in November 2022 with the release of ChatGPT, followed by the first raft of commercially targeted products in the fall of 2023. At that point, there was no clarity on whether and when the technology would offer a return. However, as product development and more robust infrastructure have led to mainstream pickup of GenAI products, there’s more visibility on the potential for revenue and profits, Weiss says.
Of the $1.1 trillion revenue opportunity forecast for 2028, $400 billion would come from corporate spending on software focused on productivity improvements from automation. “We took a look at the labor and wage calculations that GenAI can impact,” Weiss says. “And that's where productivity gains come from.”
Consumer platforms, which include ecommerce, search, social media, autonomous and wearables, could generate additional revenue of $680 billion as companies automate their consumer processes, making shopping and devices more efficient.
For 2025, Morgan Stanley Research predicts potential revenue of $153 billion, with enterprise software accounting for $59 billion. Consumer platforms would generate the remaining $94 billion in sales.
In fact, for the first time, return on investment (ROI) is expected to be positive with analysts expecting GenAI to yield a 34% contribution margin, or the equivalent of $51 billion in 2025. Last year, GenAI ROI, with expenses, resulted in a -5% contribution margin.
By 2028, ROI is expected to remain positive and rise to a 67% contribution margin, or $722 billion return.
“That leads us to the conclusion that GenAI’s return profile is not meaningfully different from the gross margins of today's software and Internet solutions,” says Brian Nowak, who leads U.S. Internet Research at Morgan Stanley.
Call Centers Showing Benefits of GenAI
Savings from labor are likely to become a major validation of the efficacy of GenAI in the near term.
Customer call centers are one example: They’ve been significantly reducing the need for the intervention of a human operator with the application of GenAI.
“There’s evidence of savings of real dollars. That's what's going to incite a lot more adoption of GenAI,” Weiss says. “Breakthrough technologies will continue to emerge over the next three years, and they will open up opportunities not just to create efficiencies within existing processes, but to completely rewrite business processes.”
Hardware Spending Keeps Growing
Developing hardware for GenAI innovation has been a bottleneck in this technology cycle. An AI model that is 10% smarter might require five times more hardware, according to Joe Moore, Head of U.S. Semiconductors Research at Morgan Stanley.
“You're looking at a really dramatic increase in the amount of hardware,” says Moore. “Hardware companies are focused on how to deliver that so that it doesn't become prohibitively expensive.”
Moore notes that, despite the
recent development
of some AI models with smaller amounts of hardware, major companies continue to increase their spending plans.
GenAI Semiconductor spending is forecasted to reach $280 billion in 2028, from $115 billion in 2024, and is well supported by this level of GenAI returns.
Spending on hardware, networking and memory for GenAI is likely to almost triple to $276 billion in 2028, from $98 billion in 2024.
“We've heard from most of the big spenders in the market that they’re continuing to scale up,” Weiss says. “This is not a bubble. This is investment that's driven by these areas of economic benefit that our software and internet teams are seeing.”

Tax Cut Costs May Outweigh Benefits
Mar 19, 2025
Proposed tax and spending cuts from Washington pose risks to the economic outlook. Should investors brace for more market turmoil?
Author
Lisa Shalett
Key Takeaways
Soaring policy uncertainty is roiling markets, with the S&P 500 Index having entered correction territory last week.
Proposed tax and spending cuts may stoke further uncertainty by adding to the U.S. debt load and failing to stimulate much growth.
Tariff revenue projections may be overly optimistic, failing to account for potential retaliatory measures and lower import volumes.
Investors should consider looking for stocks with stable growth and diversifying across global regions to help mitigate risks.
The S&P 500 Index was recently hovering around a correction of 10% from its recent high. Disappointing economic data, the Federal Reserve’s pause in interest rate cuts and, more recently, investors’ soaring uncertainty around U.S. government policy are driving much of the market turmoil. Investing and consumer spending rely on confidence in the economy, and that confidence has been deeply shaken.
This dynamic has led many forecasters, including Morgan Stanley Research, to cut their real gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimates for this year and next. Importantly, with tariff concerns boosting expectations for higher inflation, the odds of “stagflation”—in which growth slows and inflation heats up—are rising, which can spell trouble for stocks and bonds. At this point, for many investors, a resumption of the bull market rides on a pivot in Washington’s agenda from tariffs to tax cuts and deregulation.
Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee is certainly encouraged by the possibility that deregulation could support growth in sectors like financials and energy. However, we are skeptical that tax cuts and fiscal reform will significantly stimulate economic growth or improve the U.S. debt outlook. Several reasons underpin this skepticism and suggest that more uncertainty and market turbulence may be ahead.
Wealth Management
Ways and Means
Soaring policy uncertainty has shaken investor confidence. Will tax cuts help reinstate the bull case? There’s reason to be cautious. Learn why, and where investors may find opportunity amid volatility.
Share
n/a
1
Budget plans fail to significantly improve the U.S. debt outlook.
The recent budget blueprint from the GOP-controlled House of Representatives proposes an extension of President Trump’s expiring 2017 tax law for the next decade at a cost of up to $4.5 trillion, while also calling for $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion in spending cuts. However, achieving these cuts is politically challenging, especially given the thin majority in the House and the popularity of programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which are significant targets for these cuts. Even in the best-case scenario, the proposed cuts would only slightly dent the 10-year U.S. debt and deficit forecast, potentially increasing federal debt by about $2.8 trillion and adding $600 billion in annual interest costs. Federal debt and deficits are already outsized, and their continued growth could lead to higher interest rates that may weigh on economic activity and asset prices.
2
Tax cuts’ economic benefits may not offset the costs.
Many investors believe growth will come from the prospect of new measures, like lifting the $10,000 cap on state and local tax (SALT) deductions and eliminating taxes on tips or overtime pay. Here, the problem is not simply the sheer cost of these proposals but also the Congressional requirement that they, too, be paid for. Proposals to claw back money from the Biden-era CHIPS, Infrastructure and Inflation Reduction acts, for example, could have adverse impacts given the high level of economic activity such programs generate for each dollar of fiscal stimulus. These potential negatives are unlikely to be offset by positive effects from tax cuts for higher-income households and corporations, which tend to save and invest more than they spend.
3
Tariffs may not increase revenue as much as expected.
Estimates suggest that 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada and an additional 10% on China, if fully implemented, could raise about $120 billion in a year for the government. That is a significant number, but there are reasons to doubt that revenues would be that large. For one, we have seen President Trump’s willingness to make changes and exceptions. Furthermore, 50% of imports from Canada and Mexico are expected to be deemed compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and not be subject to recently announced tariffs. Most importantly, these gross estimates of revenues from tariffs don’t account for the negative impacts of retaliation, the substitution of alternative products or potentially weaker import volumes.
Next Moves for Investors
Considering all this, markets are likely to remain volatile and idiosyncratic. Risk management is paramount.
In this environment, investors should consider being opportunistic and adding stocks of companies that have shown stable growth, in sectors such as software, health care, consumer services and cyclicals like financials.
Also continue to diversify regionally across emerging markets, Japan and select European names, using funding from long-duration rates.

https://www.morganstanley.com/wealth-investmentsolutions/wmir-definitions
Risk Considerations
Equity securities
may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.
Bonds
are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.
Bonds rated below investment grade
may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market.  Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds.  High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.
Yields
are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.
Investing in foreign markets
entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. These risks are magnified in countries with
emerging markets and frontier markets
, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.
Because of their narrow focus,
sector investments
tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.
Technology stocks
may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the
energy and natural resources
sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk.
Health care sector stocks
are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.
Asset allocation and diversification
do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.
Artificial intelligence (AI)
is subject to limitations, and you should be aware that any output from an AI-supported tool or service made available by the Firm for your use is subject to such limitations, including but not limited to inaccuracy, incompleteness, or embedded bias.  You should always verify the results of any AI-generated output.
Rebalancing
does not protect against a loss in declining financial markets.  There may be a potential tax implication with a rebalancing strategy.  Investors should consult with their tax advisor before implementing such a strategy.
The
indices
are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.  They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. The indices are not subject to expenses or fees and are often comprised of securities and other investment instruments the liquidity of which is not restricted. A particular investment product may consist of securities significantly different than those in any index referred to herein. Comparing an investment to a particular index may be of limited use.

Home Loans
Will Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2025?
Mar 4, 2025
Mortgage rates are forecast to drop over time, but affordability likely won’t return to pre-pandemic levels. Here’s what to expect.
Key Takeaways
Mortgage rates could fall with Treasury yields and home prices could decrease slightly amid increased housing supply.
1
The decision of whether and when to buy a home is both economic and personal, with many buyers hoping to refinance in the future.
It’s important to consider your financing options and evaluate how current mortgage rates and home prices could affect your overall financial plan.
With mortgage rates easing marginally last year, potential homebuyers may be wondering if now is the right time to get into the housing market. However, several uncertainties remain: Will mortgage rates go down? Will the U.S. housing shortage ease? And will the recent rapid growth in home prices slow?
The good news is: Morgan Stanley strategists anticipate that mortgage rates could fall with Treasury yields over the next two years and home prices may decrease slightly amid increased housing supply.
1
That, however, does not necessarily mean a return to the pre-pandemic era of more affordable mortgages and home prices.
If you’re considering entering the market this year, here’s what you should know.
How Did Mortgage Rates Get So High?
Investors and potential homebuyers have experienced rapid change in recent years as interest rates plummeted, then shot back up, only to begin declining again.
After the 2020 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) slashed rates, which helped drive 30-year mortgage rates to a low of 2.65% in early 2021,
2
sparking a homebuying surge. By October 2023, due to high inflation,
rates soared to nearly 7.80%,
2
which significantly impacted the U.S. housing market by making homes less affordable.
In 2024, as inflation settled closer to the Fed’s 2% target, the central bank reduced its benchmark rate a full percentage point. However,
Fed rate cuts don’t necessarily lead to lower mortgage rates
. With longer-term yields fluctuating throughout 2024 and into 2025, the 30-year fixed ended January 2025 just below 7%
2
—lower than in mid-2024, but still far above pre-pandemic levels.
Will Mortgage Rates Go Down in 2025 and 2026?
Morgan Stanley strategists forecast that in 2025, mortgage rates could fall with Treasury yields, and home prices could decrease slightly amid increased housing supply.
1
However the magnitude of a potential drop in mortgage rates is uncertain.
In 2026, the strategists say, a slowing in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth could take Treasury yields lower and mortgage rates with them, further helping affordability.
1
The potential declines could translate to improvements in housing affordability. For example, for a $1 million home, the monthly cost today could be $5,322 at a 7% rate, versus $4,925 at a 6.25% rate—roughly a $397 monthly difference.
3,4
Where Will Home Prices Be in 2025 and 2026?
Homes are still generally less affordable today than they were just five years ago, with average prices up about 30% since early 2020.
5
That means that a $1 million home in 2019 could now list for $1.3 million.
With mortgage rates still high by recent historical standards, many homeowners who already secured much lower rates have a strong incentive to hold onto their current home. This creates a “lock-in effect” that has helped sustain upward pressure on prices in recent years as far fewer existing homes came on the market. (Some homeowners may explore a cash-out refinance to withdraw equity and capitalize on the surge in home equity values following the pandemic.)
Looking ahead, Morgan Stanley strategists anticipate a continued slow increase in residential investment through 2026, with a rapid rise in housing starts (new home construction), new home sales and more turnover in existing home sales.
1
These changes may drive more housing inventory, which could help ease some of the pressure on housing prices.
Is Now the Right Time to Get Back in the Housing Market?
Ultimately, whether now is the right time to buy or sell a home can be just as much a personal decision as it is an economic one. For example, a young couple starting their family may be willing to pay a premium to get into a specific school district, while a retiree may be ready to buy their dream vacation home while they can enjoy it. For many of today’s buyers, there is also the hope that they can refinance down the road to lower their costs, making it an easier choice to buy at a higher rate now.
Whatever your circumstance, your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor can help you understand your financing options and evaluate how today’s mortgage rates and home prices could affect your overall financial plan.

2025 Outlook: Checking on 5 Core Fixed Income Sectors
Feb 12, 2025
After a long bull market for bonds, here’s how you can navigate evolving market conditions to optimize your investment strategy for the year ahead.
Author
Steve Edwards, Head of Portfolio Construction and Cross-Asset Strategy, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
Key Takeaways
With the Fed’s rate adjustments and ongoing economic shifts, a selective approach to bond investing will be crucial in 2025.
Treasuries may offer a lower-volatility option with attractive yields around 4.5%, providing a cushion against potential rate rises.
Agency mortgage-backed securities have been resilient amid higher rates, whereas TIPS may see only limited gains if inflation cools.
A healthy economic backdrop could support investment-grade corporate and municipal bonds, but they, too, pose some risk.
After a decades-long bull market for bonds, in which yields fell and prices were stable, many investors find themselves in unfamiliar terrain at the outset of a new cycle for fixed income: Bond rates remain well above the near-zero levels of the last decade, driven higher by resilient U.S. economic growth and persistent inflationary pressures while the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates following a rapid series of hikes in 2022-2023. Investors’ concerns about the growing federal debt load and uncertainty around how the new presidential administration’s policies might unfold have only added to recent upward pressure on yields.
Higher rates can mean bigger coupon payments but also lower bond prices, which move inversely to rates, creating risks but also opportunities for discerning investors.
Against this backdrop, how should you consider navigating fixed income markets in 2025? Here’s a closer look at the Morgan Stanley Global Investment Office’s outlook for lower-risk “core” fixed income sectors, which are considered a fundamental part of a
diversified investment portfolio
, often used to help generate income and preserve wealth.
1
U.S. Treasuries
Despite the recent rise in U.S. Treasury yields, there remains a strong case for maintaining more exposure to U.S. Treasuries in a taxable bond portfolio. That’s because in addition to their lower-risk profile, they currently offer attractive yields around 4.5%. This creates a “yield cushion” that could help offset potential price declines should rates rise further.
Current lower valuations may offer attractive entry points for investors, especially if upcoming inflation reports align with or fall below Wall Street’s expectations, spurring a rally.
At the same time, investors should be mindful of “duration,” which is a measure of how sensitive a bond’s price is to interest rates. Longer-duration bonds see greater price declines when rates rise. Given the outlook for higher-for-longer rates, investors should aim for a “neutral” overall duration, roughly in-line with that for a benchmark like the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. This may help balance the trade-offs between income and the potential risk of price swings.
2
Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS)
TIPS are U.S. government bonds designed to help protect investors from inflation by adjusting in face value based on the consumer price index. TIPS currently appear less attractive, as rising inflation-adjusted, or “real,” yields may challenge their potential for capital appreciation. Also, TIPS typically gain when consumer prices are heating up. Key inflation measures have recently plateaued around 3%, however, and may be somewhat lower by year-end, likely muting possible upward adjustments in TIPS’ principal value.

3
Agency mortgage-backed securities
In contrast to TIPS, agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) might offer modest excess returns and a more balanced risk-reward profile, especially if rate volatility continues to decline. Their valuation when compared to other core fixed income assets, like U.S. Treasuries and investment-grade (IG) corporate bonds, appears fair.
Also keep in mind that:
Agency MBS have recently benefited from a rise in banks retaining mortgages rather than securitizing them, which reduces the overall MBS supply and supports their prices.
They have shown resilient performance despite rising Treasury yields, higher mortgage rates and a softening of agency MBS demand amid more all-cash home purchases.
4
Investment-grade corporate bonds
Higher yields make investment-grade corporate bonds look moderately attractive, even though the extra yield an investor can expect for taking on risk in corporate bonds rather than U.S. Treasuries (known as “credit spread”) remains small. While a healthy economic backdrop, stable credit fundamentals and robust demand have buoyed the sector, the potential for significant excess returns from tightening credit spreads appears limited.
5
Municipal bonds
These fixed income securities are issued by U.S. state and local governments and are exempt from federal income tax and, in some cases, state and local taxes as well. They remain a viable option for investors seeking tax-advantaged income, particularly those in higher tax brackets.
Historically low unemployment, resilient consumer activity, receding inflationary pressures and solid home prices should support healthy revenue growth and stable credit conditions for municipals. Investors do face risks due to increased local and state governments’ reliance on borrowing and potential budgetary pressures, as federal aid wanes, however.

Municipal bonds remain a viable option for investors seeking tax-advantaged income.
What strategy makes sense for you?
In 2025, investors will have to carefully balance opportunities for yield and return against potential risks. With the Fed’s rate adjustments and ongoing economic shifts, a selective approach to bond investing, focused on diversification and duration management, will be crucial.
As always, it’s important to align investment choices with personal financial goals and market conditions.

Risk Considerations
Equity securities
may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.
Bonds
are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.
Bonds rated below investment grade
may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market.  Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds.  High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.
The majority of $25 and $1000 par
preferred securities
are “callable” meaning that the issuer may retire the securities at specific prices and dates prior to maturity. Interest/dividend payments on certain preferred issues may be deferred by the issuer for periods of up to 5 to 10 years, depending on the particular issue. The investor would still have income tax liability even though payments would not have been received. Price quoted is per $25 or $1,000 share, unless otherwise specified. Current yield is calculated by multiplying the coupon by par value divided by the market price.
Some $25 or $1000 par
preferred securities
are QDI (Qualified Dividend Income) eligible. Information on QDI eligibility is obtained from third party sources. The dividend income on QDI eligible preferreds qualifies for a reduced tax rate. Many traditional ‘dividend paying’ perpetual preferred securities (traditional preferreds with no maturity date) are QDI eligible.  In order to qualify for the preferential tax treatment all qualifying preferred securities must be held by investors for a minimum period – 91 days during a 180 day window period, beginning 90 days before the ex-dividend date.
Interest on
municipal bonds
is generally exempt from federal income tax; however, some bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Also, municipal bonds acquired in the secondary market at a discount may be subject to the market discount tax provisions, and therefore could give rise to taxable income.  Typically, state tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one’s state of residence and, if applicable, local tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one’s city of residence. The tax-exempt status of municipal securities may be changed by legislative process, which could affect their value and marketability
Yields
are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.
Investing in foreign markets
entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks.
Investing in currency
involves additional special risks such as credit, interest rate fluctuations, derivative investment risk, and domestic and foreign inflation rates, which can be volatile and may be less liquid than other securities and more sensitive to the effect of varied economic conditions. In addition, international investing entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with
emerging markets and frontier markets
, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.
Alternative investments
may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.
Hedge funds
may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.
Companies paying
dividends
can reduce or cut payouts at any time.
Investing in commodities
entails significant risks. Commodity prices may be affected by a variety of factors at any time, including but not limited to, (i) changes in supply and demand relationships, (ii) governmental programs and policies, (iii) national and international political and economic events, war and terrorist events, (iv) changes in interest and exchange rates, (v) trading activities in commodities and related contracts, (vi) pestilence, technological change and weather, and (vii) the price volatility of a commodity. In addition, the commodities markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, participation of speculators and government intervention.
Physical precious metals
are non-regulated products. Precious metals are speculative investments, which may experience short-term and long-term price volatility. The value of precious metals investments may fluctuate and may appreciate or decline, depending on market conditions. If sold in a declining market, the price you receive may be less than your original investment. Unlike bonds and stocks, precious metals do not make interest or dividend payments. Therefore, precious metals may not be appropriate for investors who require current income. Precious metals are commodities that should be safely stored, which may impose additional costs on the investor. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) provides certain protection for customers’ cash and securities in the event of a brokerage firm’s bankruptcy, other financial difficulties, or if customers’ assets are missing. SIPC insurance does not apply to precious metals or other commodities.
Because of their narrow focus,
sector investments
tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.
Technology stocks
may be especially volatile. Risks applicable to companies in the
energy and natural resources
sectors include commodity pricing risk, supply and demand risk, depletion risk and exploration risk.
Health care sector stocks
are subject to government regulation, as well as government approval of products and services, which can significantly impact price and availability, and which can also be significantly affected by rapid obsolescence and patent expirations.
Asset allocation and diversification
do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.
Value investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.
Growth investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.
Artificial intelligence (AI)
is subject to limitations, and you should be aware that any output from an AI-supported tool or service made available by the Firm for your use is subject to such limitations, including but not limited to inaccuracy, incompleteness, or embedded bias.  You should always verify the results of any AI-generated output.
Rebalancing
does not protect against a loss in declining financial markets.  There may be a potential tax implication with a rebalancing strategy.  Investors should consult with their tax advisor before implementing such a strategy.
The
indices
are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.  They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. The indices are not subject to expenses or fees and are often comprised of securities and other investment instruments the liquidity of which is not restricted. A particular investment product may consist of securities significantly different than those in any index referred to herein. Comparing an investment to a particular index may be of limited use.

Yes, You Can Be a Tech Innovator at Morgan Stanley

Learn what kind of growth opportunities and career advantages we can offer technologists that big tech often can’t.
If you’re a technologist, whether just out of school or well established in your career, you may assume you will always work at a big tech firm, a startup, your own entrepreneurial venture—or some combination of the three. The notion of working in financial technology at a bank like Morgan Stanley may not be one you’ve considered, but it should be. We know what you may be thinking: A bank? What kind of energy, innovation and job satisfaction could a bank provide a coder, machine-learning engineer or data scientist? Turns out, quite a bit.
We asked Sigal Zarmi, Senior Advisor for Technology and a former Chief Information Officer at Morgan Stanley, to share her thoughts on the benefits of working in financial technology at Morgan Stanley. Zarmi joined Morgan Stanley in 2018 and is responsible for driving the firm’s innovation and transformation agenda. She became a Senior Advisor in 2021. Here are her top takeaways.
1. The Myths About Tech at Banks Are Just That
“A lot of people think that because banking is such an established industry it’s not tech-friendly,” says Zarmi. ”What they don’t realize is just how much technology is being leveraged by banks. Technology is really the production line of financial services, and Morgan Stanley is at the forefront of that,” Zarmi adds. “We were the first bank to seriously invest in electronic trading—and we’ve reaped the benefits by becoming the leader in that space. Today we are leveraging big data, AI and machine learning to better serve our clients and to make our business more efficient. Additionally, we are partnering with other organizations to explore the potential of emerging technologies, such as blockchain, quantum computing and augmented/virtual reality.
2. You'll Be Joining an Extraordinary Team
“What impressed me the most when I came to Morgan Stanley was the technical depth and proficiency I found,” says Zarmi. “And we reward that proficiency. Among our talented group of technologists are 20 Distinguished Engineers who have been recognized inside and outside the firm as not only  influencers with superior technical expertise, but as mentors to the next generation.”
3. You'll Have a Chance to Collaborate on Exciting, Challenging and Rewarding Projects
“Whether it’s finding solutions to improve low-latency trading, leveraging AI to inform investment decisions, or applying natural language processing to help assess the quality of a loan, the problems we tackle are really complex and challenging,” says Zarmi.
“And they often require teams across functions and expertise areas to partner and collaborate to find solutions. Which means the work is always interesting and varied and there’s always talent from across the firm working together towards a common goal.”
The possibilities within tech are varied as well. Says Zarmi, “There is real opportunity to apply high-level technical and engineering skills in all disciplines of application development and cybersecurity, as well as infrastructure tooling, servers and storage, communications and connectivity, and multiple new technologies.”
4. There's a True Commitment to Innovation
“Technology is changing at breath-taking speed, and there’s not a single aspect of our business that we don’t consider ripe for disruption.” says Zarmi. “Here at Morgan Stanley, we take a three-pronged approach to innovation: We have Centers of Excellence to drive adoption of advanced technologies and methodologies, such as AI/ML, cloud, data analytics and Agile/DevOps. We have an innovation group that provides tools and resources to our employees to experiment and deliver projects that help solve real business challenges. And we work with vendors—both mature and emerging—who complement and expand our innovation capabilities. Experimentation and innovation are woven into the very fabric of our organization, so it’s not surprising that we were recently honored for our entrepreneurial culture by being named the only financial services firm on Fast Company’s recent list of 50 Best Workplaces for Innovators."
5. You'll Have Ownership of Your Work
“This might surprise you given how large and complex banks are. But you can really take charge of your projects—and your future—here,” says Zarmi. “At big technology companies, you’re often a cog in a wheel. Our focus is on giving people meaningful work and allowing them to be part of smaller, self-directed and self-sufficient teams, where they are empowered to drive decision-making and where they can immediately see the impact they are making.”
6. We Value Your Passion
When hiring, Zarmi says, “I look beyond the technical skills for a sense of passion. I want to see a candidate’s curiosity for constant learning and development and their willingness to adapt. In turn, we make sure to support our technologists in their ambitions, wherever they lead them. Not just through traditional mentorship but through grassroots  innovation programs, hackathons, open source projects and broader engagement with the tech community through industry events."
7. We Support Your Career and Offer Mobility
“You’re not pigeon-holed here at Morgan Stanley,” says Zarmi. “If you are technically competent and have the right leadership skills, opportunities across functions and in offices all over the world will open up to you, from Mumbai and Bengaluru to London and Budapest to New York and Montreal. And our senior leadership is truly committed to helping technologists leverage those opportunities."
8. We Offer a Culture Centered Around Community
“This firm is much more than a bank with an impressive technology shop,” says Zarmi. “It’s an organization that has strong values around community, diversity and giving back, including our initiatives to foster STEM education from K through college. And once you are here, we make sure you know you belong through the efforts of our affinity groups such as Women in Tech, the Pride & Ally Network and the Black Employee Network. It’s a culture that truly celebrates diversity, achievement and innovation.”

As a warming planet affects human health, investors have an opportunity to support initiatives that address climate-related health risks and help reduce long-term costs.
Hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves and floods—all made worse by a warming climate—are impacting the global economy, damaging property and infrastructure, decreasing crop yields, affecting tourism and more. In the U.S. alone, the historic number of weather- and climate-related disasters in 2023 resulted in record-breaking costs of $92.9 billion.
1
Yet beyond this visible devastation lies a quieter, and potentially costlier, threat: the impact on human health.
The U.S. already incurs more than $820 billion each year for hospitalizations, injuries, medical treatments, mental health conditions and lost wages linked to air pollution and climate change.
2
As extreme weather events become more intense and frequent, so too will the risks of respiratory illness, heat stroke, infectious disease through contaminated water and food sources, malnutrition and debris-related injuries—all of which will drive up health-related costs (see Exhibit 1). Additionally, in the aftermath of natural disasters, communities are often left grappling with mental health challenges including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress. Those who are already most vulnerable, including children and low-income communities, are likely to be most affected.
But despite the urgency, there has been limited investment in proactive preventive solutions: Just 3% of global health spending is directed toward prevention of climate-related health issues,
3
and only 5% of climate finance is allocated to adaptation efforts.
4
Morgan Stanley sees a critical need for investors to help mitigate the root causes of climate-related health risks, as well as investor appetite to do so. In a
recent survey
by Morgan Stanley’s
Institute for Sustainable Investing
, individual investors ranked climate action and health care as their top two sustainable investment themes globally. This signals a unique market opportunity to boost investments in preventive and sustainable solutions at the intersection of climate and health care.
Three specific investment areas stand out: 1) nature-based solutions, 2) infrastructure resilience and 3) equitable access to care. Scalable investments in these three areas could help to safeguard public health in the face of a changing climate while also reducing long-term costs.
Exhibit 1: How Climate Events Affect Human Health
Climate Hazard
Health Outcome
Estimated Costs (USD $)
Wildfires
Wildfires are predicted to be up to 1.5x more common due to climate change, and the extent and magnitude of damages are rising.
5
Increased respiratory illnesses
Higher rates of particulate air pollution exacerbate respiratory disease, leading to increased hospital admissions and deaths.
$125 billion in lost wages each year
6
Lost labor productivity from wildfire smoke reduced earnings in the U.S. by an average of $125 billion, according to a 2022 Stanford University study.
Heatwaves
Heatwaves are expected to be 2x - 5x more common due to climate change.
7
Increased heat illnesses and aggravated chronic conditions
Increased risk of heat illnesses. Extreme heat also exacerbates chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular, respiratory and diabetes-related conditions.
$100 billion in lost productivity each year
8
Above 90⁰F, productivity drops by 25%; above 100⁰F, productivity drops 70%.
9
Heat-induced declines in labor productivity cost $100 billion/year in the U.S. today; by 2050 this could reach $500 billion
10
. This is in addition to $1 billion in heat-related health care costs each summer.
Tropical Storms & Changing Rainfall Patterns
Rainfall and storm intensity are expected to increase due to climate change.
Higher rates of infectious diseases and debris-related injuries
Changing rainfall patterns means higher rates of vector- and water-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and cholera. More powerful storms also result in higher risks of trauma from debris. Indirect health impacts include infectious diseases, exacerbating chronic diseases and mental health issues. There are also higher rates of emergency room admissions and deaths in affected areas even weeks after the event.
$50 - $125 billion for increased vaccine demand
11
In addition to growing demand for vaccines against infectious diseases, health costs from tropical storms can be costly. Hurricane Sandy health costs estimated at $3.3 billion.
12
Droughts
By the late 21
st
century, the land area and population expected to face droughts could more than double globally.
13
Higher risks of malnutrition and food insecurity
Heatwaves and droughts exacerbate food insecurity by impacting farming and fishing. Depending on the progress of decarbonization efforts, losses in agricultural yields due to climate change are projected to put between 8 million and 80 million people at risk of hunger by 2050.
14
$53 billion in annual healthcare costs
15
Estimates from the U.S. show that food insecurity triggers or worsens chronic diseases and fuels hospitalizations, all of which drive up healthcare costs. These economic costs are predicted to be much higher in lower-income countries.
Floods
With river flooding, populations impacted could rise by 120% in a 2⁰C world, and nearly 400% in a 4⁰C world.
16
Increased risk of drinking water contamination
Extreme rainfall and storm surges will increase the risk that drinking water, wastewater and stormwater infrastructure will fail due to either damage or exceedance of system capacity. This is in addition to the diminished ability to practice good hygiene. As a result, the risk of exposure to water-related pathogens, chemicals, and algal toxins will increase in receiving waters and, when that enters source waters, may complicate drinking water treatment efforts.
$3.33 billion per year
17
Estimates of healthcare costs incurred in the U.S. because of 17 water-borne infectious diseases each year, including otitis externa and norovirus infection. This doesn’t include the costs to repair water infrastructure.
** These figures do not add up to the $820 billion figure in the first paragraph as they are not solely U.S. figures and are not from the same source.
3 Ways Investors Can Scale Preventative Climate-Health Solutions
Reactive responses to disasters may garner attention, but preemptive efforts to minimize risks yield more sustainable and cost-effective outcomes in the long run. Investors can help by realigning capital toward preventive measures that mitigate climate impacts on health while reducing long-term costs.
Efforts in three key investment areas can benefit climate and health.
1. Nature-Based Solutions
Harnessing and scaling
nature-based solutions
can mitigate the effects of climate hazards such as droughts, wildfires and heatwaves while also promoting greater biodiversity and improving health outcomes. Urban forestry initiatives that expand tree coverage, for instance, not only mitigate the urban heat island effect from extreme temperatures but also improve air quality and can enhance overall well-being. Estimates suggest that increasing tree coverage in cities by 30% could reduce premature deaths in urban heat islands by nearly 40%.
18
Beyond urban centers, improved forest management programs can reduce wildfire risks and the resulting health impacts from poor air quality. While a pre-emptive approach of removing some vegetation is costly, it can pay for itself in avoided losses in just two to three years, according to the American Forest Foundation.
19
Investments in drought resilience and adaptation measures, including improved crop production technologies and regenerative agriculture practices, could help reduce the risk food insecurity and malnutrition. Additionally, investing in natural coastal defenses such as plants, reefs and wetlands can simultaneously preserve biodiversity and ecosystem services, while also delivering cost-effective benefits that protect and preserve coastal communities from storm surges and increased flood risks. Watershed restoration can also help protect drinking water sources.
2. Infrastructure Resilience
Upgrading infrastructure can be a cornerstone of climate adaptation efforts. Retrofitting buildings to meet or exceed building code requirements and updating existing structures in disaster-prone areas can enhance safety by reducing the risk of debris-related injuries from extreme storms or floods.
By 2050, more than 80% of people in urban areas will need access to air conditioning to cope with extreme temperatures.
20
Providing greater access to climate-controlled shelter, including cost-effective retrofits that include both air conditioning and air purification systems that mitigate harmful pollutants, can help reduce the risk of heat illnesses and lessen the impact of pollution and higher temperatures on chronic conditions.
Upgrading infrastructure for drinking water, wastewater and stormwater management to be more resilient against more intense storms and floods has the potential to reduce exposure to water-related pathogens, chemicals and algal toxins that may complicate drinking water treatment efforts.
3. Access to Care
Climate risks to health care facilities also threaten access to care, with more than one third of community health center sites in the U.S. located in areas of high relative climate vulnerability.21 Ensuring equitable access to health care, including meeting growing demand for vaccines as well as treatments for vector- or water-borne infectious diseases and malnutrition, is pivotal in mitigating the direct impacts of climate change on human health. Initiatives such as the World Bank’s Climate and Health program, announced at COP28, provide insight into where investments can improve care: strengthening surveillance and early warning systems for climate events; climate-proofing health facilities; and better responding to climate-driven disease patterns.
22
Climate change also exacerbates mental health risk factors as people face displacement, loss of livelihoods and access to basic services, increased uncertainty about the future and impacts from traumatic experiences. Supporting solutions that integrate mental health support with climate action can enhance resilience and address the psychological toll of climate-related disasters.
Redirecting investments toward prevention represents a proactive and potentially cost-effective approach to address the intersecting challenges of climate change and public health. Investors who embrace opportunities across infrastructure, access to care and nature-positive solutions will be helping both to mitigate costs and to address the effect that climate is having on people’s health and lives.

Certain portfolios may include investment holdings deemed Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) investments. For reference, environmental ("E") factors can include, but are not limited to, climate change, pollution, waste, and how an issuer protects and/or conserves natural resources. Social ("S") factors can include, but not are not limited to, how an issuer manages its relationships with individuals, such as its employees, shareholders, and customers as well as its community. Governance ("G") factors can include, but are not limited to, how an issuer operates, such as its leadership composition, pay and incentive structures, internal controls, and the rights of equity and debt holders. You should carefully review an investment product's prospectus or other offering documents, disclosures and/or marketing material to learn more about how it incorporates ESG factors into its investment strategy.
ESG investments may also be referred to as sustainable investments, impact aware investments, socially responsible investments or diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) investments.  It is important to understand there are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers.  This is due to a current lack of consistent global reporting and auditing standards as well as differences in definitions, methodologies, processes, data sources and subjectivity among ESG rating providers when determining a rating.  Certain issuers of investments including, but not limited to, separately managed accounts (SMAs), mutual funds and exchange traded-funds (ETFs) may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. Further, socially responsible norms vary by region, and an issuer’s ESG practices or Morgan Stanley’s assessment of an issuer’s ESG practices can change over time.
Portfolios that include investment holdings deemed ESG investments or that employ ESG screening criteria as part of an overall strategy may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices.  Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results. For risks related to a specific fund, please refer to the fund's prospectus or summary prospectus.
Investment managers can have different approaches to ESG and can offer strategies that differ from the strategies offered by other investment managers with respect to the same theme or topic. Additionally, when evaluating investments, an investment manager is dependent upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the manager to incorrectly assess an investment’s ESG characteristics or performance. Such data or information may be obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting. Morgan Stanley does not verify that such information and data is accurate and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy, timeliness, or completeness when evaluating an issuer. This can cause Morgan Stanley to incorrectly assess an issuer’s business practices with respect to its ESG practices. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products.

Historical data shown represents past performance and does not guarantee comparable future results.
Investing in the markets entails the risk of market volatility. The value of all types of investments, including stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts, may increase or decrease over varying time periods.
An investment in an exchange-traded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities traded on exchange in the relevant securities market, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. The investment return and principal value of ETF investments will fluctuate, so that an investor’s ETF shares, if or when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost.
Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.
Equity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment. Companies paying dividends can reduce or stop pay-outs at any time.
Growth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally, the longer a bond’s maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer.  Debt instruments issued by U.S. corporate and municipal issuers that provide a return in the form of fixed periodic payments and eventual return of principal at maturity. Fixed income investments are advantageous in a time of low inflation, but do not protect investors in a time of rising inflation. Interest income on government securities is subject to federal income taxes, but exempt from taxes at the state and local level.
Bond funds and bond holdings have the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the funds. The return of principal in bond funds, and in funds with significant bond holdings, is not guaranteed.

Sustainable funds hit a record AUM of $3.56 trillion but posted a median return of 0.4%, compared to traditional funds’ 1.7%.
Key Takeaways
Sustainable funds underperformed traditional funds in the second half of 2024 for the first time since the first half of 2022.
However, assets under management (AUM) in sustainable funds grew to a new high of $3.56 trillion as of December 31, 2024.
This was due to a slight recovery in flows during the last six months of the year, with net inflows of $30.6 billion in the second half of 2024, following a weak second quarter.
Sustainable funds lagged traditional funds in 2024,  according to a new "Sustainable Reality"
report

from the Morgan Stanley
Institute for Sustainable Investing
. After outperforming in the first half of the year, sustainable funds underperformed in the second half for the first time since the first half of 2022, delivering H2 2024 median returns of 0.4%, compared to traditional funds’ 1.7%.

The median returns for sustainable funds mostly underperformed that of traditional peers in 2H24
Median Return - Sustainable Funds vs. Traditional Funds

Some of the relative underperformance in the second half stemmed from sustainable funds’ market exposure. Seventy percent of sustainable funds invest either in Europe or globally, compared to just 41% of traditional funds which have more exposure to the Americas and Asia-Pacific (APAC). Sustainable funds’ skew to global and European markets is not new, but in the second half of 2024, both Americas and APAC investment regions outperformed global and Europe investment areas, unlike in prior periods in which weak returns in APAC offset stronger returns in the Americas. The sustainable funds that do invest in the Americas or APAC outperformed traditional funds in those regions.

Over a longer period, sustainable funds have outperformed traditional funds. Institute analysis of Morningstar data found that investing a hypothetical $100 into a sustainable fund in December 2018 would equate to $136 today, while investing $100 into a traditional fund over the same period would equate to $131 today.

Assets Reach New High While Market Share Declines
Sustainable funds’ AUM reached a record of $3.56 trillion at the end of 2024, an increase of 0.9% since June 2024 and 4.8% since December 2023. However, the share of sustainable funds’ AUM as a portion of total AUM declined, falling to 6.8% in 2024 from 7.3% at the end of 2023. The decline mostly reflects stronger ongoing inflows into traditional funds.

A Mixed Picture for Sustainable Fund Flows
In 2024, sustainable fund inflows totaled $54.7 billion, just over half of the $100+ billion in new assets added in both 2023 and 2022. Trends improved as the year progressed though, with outflows in the second quarter followed by net inflows of $30.6 billion in the second half of 2024.

Regional fund flows varied. On an absolute basis, Europe-domiciled sustainable funds had the most inflows, with $32.3 billion in the second half of 2024, compared to $4.5 billion for Asia-domiciled funds.  North America-domiciled funds saw outflows of $6.3 billion, which marked nine consecutive quarters of outflows in the region.
By contrast, funds investing in the Americas—even if they were not domiciled there—had the strongest inflows in absolute terms at $14.5 billion, followed by funds investing globally at $7.3 billion and funds investing in Europe at $5.8 billion.

This report is part of the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing's 'Sustainable Reality' series, which assesses the historical performance of sustainable funds against traditional funds over a specific timeframe using Morningstar data. This report analyzes performance for January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024.
The fund universe for this analysis includes closed-end funds, exchange-traded funds and open-end funds, taking the oldest share class, and excludes feeder funds, funds of funds and money market funds. In total, this analysis covered approximately 99,000 funds globally.
Morningstar classifies a fund as sustainable if “...in the prospectus or other regulatory filings it is described as focusing on sustainability, impact investing, or environmental, social or governance (ESG) factors. Funds must claim to have a sustainability objective, and/or use binding ESG criteria for their investment selection. Funds that employ only limited exclusions or only consider ESG factors in a nonbinding way are not considered to be a sustainable investment product.”
This analysis takes each fund’s classification as of June 30 (for 1H data) and December 31 (for full year data) in each year; Traditional funds are those classified as ‘Not Sustainable’ by Morningstar. Morningstar’s ‘Sustainable’ classification can differ from the newer, and still broad, European Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) Article 8 and Article 9 definitions. Over 99% of Article 9 funds are also classified as Sustainable by Morningstar, while this only applies for around 30% of Article 8 funds.
Morningstar’s calculation of total return is expressed in percentage terms and is determined each month by taking the change in monthly net asset value, reinvesting all income and capital-gains distributions during that month and dividing by the starting net asset value (NAV).

Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.
Certain portfolios may include investment holdings deemed Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) investments. For reference, environmental (“E”) factors can include, but are not limited to, climate change, pollution, waste, and how an issuer protects and/ or conserves natural resources. Social (“S”) factors can include, but not are not limited to, how an issuer manages its relationships with individuals, such as its employees, shareholders, and customers as well as its community. Governance (“G”) factors can include, but are not limited to, how an issuer operates, such as its leadership composition, pay and incentive structures, internal controls, and the rights of equity and debt holders. You should carefully review an investment product’s prospectus or other offering documents, disclosures and/or marketing material to learn more about how it incorporates ESG factors into its investment strategy.
ESG investments may also be referred to as Sustainable investments, impact aware investments, socially responsible investments or diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) investments. It is important to understand there are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. This is due to a current lack of consistent global reporting and auditing standards as well as differences in definitions, methodologies, processes, data sources and subjectivity among ESG rating providers when determining a rating. Certain issuers of investments including, but not limited to, separately managed accounts (SMAs), mutual funds and exchange traded-funds (ETFs) may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. Further, socially responsible norms vary by region, and an issuer’s ESG practices or Morgan Stanley’s assessment of an issuer’s ESG practices can change over time.
Portfolios that include investment holdings deemed ESG investments or that employ ESG screening criteria as part of an overall strategy may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results. For risks related to a specific fund, please refer to the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus.
Investment managers can have different approaches to ESG and can offer strategies that differ from the strategies offered by other investment managers with respect to the same theme or topic. Additionally, when evaluating investments, an investment manager is dependent upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the manager to incorrectly assess an investment’s ESG characteristics or performance. Such data or information may be obtained through voluntary or third-party reporting. Morgan Stanley does not verify that such information and data is accurate and makes no representation or warranty as to its accuracy, timeliness, or completeness when evaluating an issuer. This can cause Morgan Stanley to incorrectly assess an issuer’s business practices with respect to its ESG practices. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products.
The appropriateness of a particular ESG investment or strategy will depend on an investor’s individual circumstances and objectives. Principal value and return of an investment will fluctuate with changes in market conditions.
Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss in a declining financial market.
Any securities mentioned are provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell. Securities discussed in this report may not be appropriate for all investors. It should not be assumed that the securities transactions or holdings discussed were or will be profitable.

Historical data shown represents past performance and does not guarantee comparable future results.
Investing in the markets entails the risk of market volatility. The value of all types of investments, including stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), closed-end funds, and unit investment trusts, may increase or decrease over varying time periods.
An investment in an exchange-traded fund involves risks similar to those of investing in a broadly based portfolio of equity securities traded on exchange in the relevant securities market, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in stock prices. The investment return and principal value of ETF investments will fluctuate, so that an investor’s ETF shares, if or when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost.
Because of their narrow focus, sector investments tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.
Equity securities may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment. Companies paying dividends can reduce or stop pay-outs at any time.
Growth investing does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.
Bonds are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally, the longer a bond’s maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer.  Debt instruments issued by U.S. corporate and municipal issuers that provide a return in the form of fixed periodic payments and eventual return of principal at maturity. Fixed income investments are advantageous in a time of low inflation, but do not protect investors in a time of rising inflation. Interest income on government securities is subject to federal income taxes, but exempt from taxes at the state and local level.
Bond funds and bond holdings have the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds owned by the funds. The return of principal in bond funds, and in funds with significant bond holdings, is not guaranteed.

Rachel Fletcher:
Welcome to Thoughts on the Market. I'm Rachel Fletcher Morgan Stanley's, Head of EMEA Sustainability Research.
Arushi Agarwal:
And I'm Arushi Agarwal European Sustainability Strategist, based in London.
Rachel Fletcher:
From kombucha to kimchi, probiotic rich fermented foods have long been staples at health-focused grocers. On the show today, a deeper dive into the future of fermentation technology. Does it hold the key to meeting the world's growing nutrition needs as people live longer, healthier lives?
It's Wednesday, 26th of March, at 3 pm in London.
Many of you listening may remember hearing about longevity. It's one of our four long-term secular themes that we're following closely at Morgan Stanley; and this year we are looking even more closely at a sub-theme – affordable, healthy nutrition. Arushi, in your recent report, you highlight that traditional agriculture is facing many significant challenges. What are they and how urgent is this situation?
Arushi Agarwal:
There are four key environmental and social issues that we highlight in the note. Now, the first two, which are related to emissions intensity and resource consumption are quite well known. So traditional agriculture is responsible for almost a third of global greenhouse gas emissions, and it also uses more than 50 percent of the world's land and freshwater resources. What we believe are issues that are less focused on – are related to current agricultural practices and climate change that could affect our ability to serve the rising demand for nutrition.
We highlight some studies in the note. One of them states that the produce that we have today has on average 40 percent less nutrition than it did over 80 years ago; and this is due to elevated use of chemicals and decline in soil fertility. Another study that we refer to estimates that average yields could decline by 30 to 50 percent before the end of the century, and this is even in the slowest of the warming scenarios.
Rachel Fletcher:
I think everyone would agree that there are four very serious issues. Are there potential solutions to these challenges?
Arushi Agarwal:
Yes, so when we've written about the future of food previously, we've identified alternative proteins, precision agriculture, and seeds technology as possible solutions for improving food security and reducing emissions.
If I focus on alternative proteins, this category has so far been dominated by plant-based food, which has seen a moderation in growth due to challenges related to taste and price. However, we still see significant need for alternative proteins, and synthetic biology-led fermentation is a new way to tap into this market.
In simple terms, this technology involves growing large amounts of microorganisms in tanks, which can then be harvested and used as a source of protein or other nutrients. We believe this technology can support healthy longevity, provide access to reliable and affordable food, and also fill many of the nutritional gaps that are related to plant-based food.
Rachel Fletcher:
So how big is the fermentation market and why are we focusing on it right now?
Arushi Agarwal:
So, we estimate a base case of $30 billion by 2030. This represents a 5,000-kiloton market for fermented proteins. We think the market will develop in two phases. Phase one from 2025 to 2027 will be focused on whey protein and animal nutrition. We are already seeing a few players sell products at competitive prices in these markets. Moving on to phase two from 2028 to 2030, we expect the market will expand to the egg, meat and daily replacement industry.
There are a few reasons we think investors should start paying attention now. 2024 was a pivotal year in validating the technology's proof of concept. A lot of companies moved from labs to pilot state. They achieved regulatory approvals to sell their products in markets like U.S. and Singapore, and they also conducted extensive market testing. As this technology scales, we believe the next three years will be critical for commercialization.
Rachel Fletcher:
So, there's potentially significant growth there, but what's the capital investment needed for this scaling effort?
Arushi Agarwal:
A lot of CapEx will be required. Scaling of this technology will require large initial CapEx, predominantly in setting up bioreactors or fermentation tanks. Achieving our 2030 base case stamp will require 200 million liters in bioreactor capacity. This equals to an initial investment opportunity of a hundred billion dollars. But once these facilities are all set up, ongoing expenses will focus on input costs for carbon, oxygen, water, nitrogen, and electricity. PWC estimates that 40 to 60 percent of the ongoing costs with this process are associated with electricity, which makes it a key consideration for future commercial investments.
Rachel Fletcher:
Now we've talked a lot about the potential opportunity and the potential total addressable market, but what about consumer preferences? Do you think they'll be easy to shift?
Arushi Agarwal:
So, we are already seeing evidence of shifting consumer trends, which we think can be supportive of demand for fermented proteins. An analysis of Google Trends, data shows that since 2019, interest in terms like high protein diet and gut health has increased the most. Some of the products we looked at within the fermentation space not only contain fiber as expected, but they also offer a high degree of protein concentration, a lot of times ranging from 60 to 90 percent.
Additionally, food manufacturers are focusing on new format foods that provide more than one use case. For example, free from all types of allergens. Fermentation technology utilizes a very diverse range of microbial species and can provide solutions related to non-allergenic foods.
Rachel Fletcher:
We've covered a lot today, but I do want to ask a final question around policy support. What's the government's role in developing the alternative proteins market, and what's your outlook around policy in Europe, the U.S., and other key regions, for example?
Arushi Agarwal:
This is an important question. Growth of fermentation technology hinges on adequate policy support; not just to enable the technology, but also to drive demand for its products. So, in the note, we highlight various instances of ongoing policy support from across the globe. For example, regulatory approvals in the U.S., a cellular agriculture package in Netherlands, plant-based food fund in Denmark, Singapore's 30 by 30 strategy.
We believe these will all be critical in boosting the supply side of fermented products. We also mentioned Denmark's upcoming legislation on carbon tax related to agriculture emissions. We believe this could provide an indirect catalyst for demand for fermented goods. Now, whilst these initiatives support the direction of travel for this technology, it's important to acknowledge that more policy support will be needed to create a level playing field versus traditional agriculture, which as we know currently benefits from various subsidies.
Rachel Fletcher:
Arushi, this has been really interesting. Thanks so much for taking the time to talk.
Arushi Agarwal:
Thank you, Rachel. It was great speaking with you,

Homebuying & Real Estate
Bringing Equity to Homeownership
May 31, 2024
With homeownership rates on the decline and the wealth gap in the U.S. widening, state housing agencies are raising capital from private markets to provide down payment assistance and attractive mortgage rates to first-time homebuyers.
Key Takeaways
Owning a home is an important way to build personal and generational wealth.
However, homeownership rates in the U.S. are declining, with high-income households accumulating more housing wealth.
To help increase homeownership rates for lower-income first-time home buyers, particularly in underserved communities, U.S. state housing finance agencies are issuing bonds to raise money for programs that include assistance with down payments.
Morgan Stanley helps these agencies raise capital by connecting them to retail and institutional investors interested in purchasing high-quality bonds that can offer financial returns while helping to make homeownership more equitable.
For most U.S. homeowners, their house is their most valuable asset and an important way to build personal and generational wealth.
1
Right now, however, homeownership rates are declining, with the greatest losses among middle-income households.
2
At the same time the distribution of housing wealth is worsening, with low-, moderate- and middle-income households sharing less of the pie—and making the wealth gap worse.
3
In today’s high-interest-rate environment, it has become even more expensive to make monthly payments on a home, creating a challenging environment for first-time homebuyers to find an affordable mortgage and accumulate enough money for a down payment.
To ensure that households in underserved communities have access to homeownership and the opportunity to build wealth by owning a home, state housing finance agency (HFA) programs provide affordable mortgages and generous downpayment assistance money funded through bonds underwritten by Morgan Stanley. “Part of the lens around equity has been to develop financing strategies that address economic insecurity and the growing wealth gap, which enable people who have lower incomes to participate in the wealth generative power of homeownership,” said
Grace Chionuma
, Managing Director and Head of Community Development and Strategic Community Engagement in Public Finance at Morgan Stanley.
Because HFA programs differ from state to state, Morgan Stanley recently hosted a conference for 13 HFAs, to help these agencies share their initiatives, best practices and insights with each other and increase access to homeownership for low-, moderate- and middle-income homebuyers and underserved communities. One of the HFAs at the conference was the Massachusetts Housing Finance Agency (MassHousing). From 2019 through 2022, MassHousing’s Home Ownership Programs provided a total of $3.3 billion across 21,000 loans, with $836 million funded through Social Bonds
proceeds.
4
97% of the MassHousing mortgages financed with Social Bonds served households below 100% of area median income, with 56% of the loans provided to households earning below 80% of area median income. 42% of the mortgages were made to minority households. As noted by S&P Global, MassHousing’s single-family program mortgage loans cut down on the risk of gentrification and neighborhoods that are segregated by income, and MassHousing aims to spur economic growth in historically underinvested communities.
5
“HFA homeownership programs come in different shapes and sizes, and HFAs are always interested in what other states are doing,” said Geoff Proulx, Managing Director and Head of Affordable Housing in Public Finance at Morgan Stanley. “It’s becoming harder and harder for families to find affordable homes and to set aside enough money for down payments. State HFAs make a difference by providing affordable loans and down payment assistance while also providing homebuyer education and counseling designed to ensure people don’t run into trouble and can keep their properties to generate wealth over time.”
Helping with Down Payments
HFAs use a variety of strategies to help low-, moderate- and middle-income families purchase homes and have been recently augmenting down payment programs to provide larger amounts and more flexible terms. A significant impediment to first-time homebuyers is accumulating enough money for the down payment necessary to get a mortgage. Proulx underscored the importance of support during the first step of the homebuying journey: “It’s difficult for many first-time homebuyers to accumulate enough assets and cash to get a mortgage loan and make a down payment. Getting a mortgage can be daunting and keep people from being able to make an offer on a house,” he said.
Demand for Bonds Supporting Homeownership
HFAs that want to raise capital for these programs benefit from the fact that the market for green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds in the last two years has proved resilient despite geopolitical uncertainty, inflation and rising interest rates. The issuance of these bonds grew 6% in 2023 to more than $980 billion, from $925 billion in 2022 (though short of the record $1.08 trillion issuance in 2021).
6
Sustainability-focused retail and institutional investors, such as large mutual funds and bond funds, have shown interest in high-quality bonds with social designations, Proulx said. Depending on the offering, interest on social bonds that support homebuying may be exempt from federal income and state income tax, which further draws investors. “There is demand for helping increase homeownership for those that need it—and improving environmental practices within homeownership and multifamily rentals—for many investors that have aspects of their portfolios that they’re looking to fill,” he said.
Morgan Stanley is helping broaden the investor pool for HFAs’ homeownership bonds. In February 2024, European investors purchased an HFA’s social bonds for the first time, an issuance that Morgan Stanley lead managed for the Illinois Housing Development Authority (IHDA), Proulx said. “We are always looking for ways to showcase the social benefits of our HFA clients’ programs, bring in a wider audience of investors, and to lower the costs of funds for these programs,” he said.

Profile
Mona
    	             
					Eldam
Head of Morgan Stanley Singapore Technology and Distinguished Engineer
Introduction
In 2006, Mona Eldam, seven years into her career at Morgan Stanley New York, was ready for something new, yet familiar. A former-developer-turned-technology-manager, she found herself yearning to return to her software-engineering roots. “I wanted to go back to my core technical skills,” says Eldam. Knowing how committed the firm is to supporting technologists in their career paths by offering them various opportunities along the way, she decided to speak up. “I was very open with my manager, who found eight different potential opportunities for me, just by reaching out to various network connections.” Mona picked a role in Fixed Income Technology, where she designed and implemented a data model used to confirm complex over-the-counter derivatives trades and financial instruments.
More than a decade later, Eldam, now a Managing Director, Head of Morgan Stanley Singapore Technology and a Distinguished Engineer, looks back fondly on how pivoting her career helped her learn more about the business, while dramatically expanding her network. Indeed, returning to hands-on software development prepared Eldam for her next big career challenge in 2008, just as the financial crisis was unfolding. Eldam’s combination of technology and business acumen made her the perfect candidate to lead the creation of an equity derivatives trading database from the ground-up, managing a new team that worked directly with front-line users of the firm’s technology to drive innovation.
Eldam recently was asked if she’d be interested in expanding her role and team in India. “I literally jumped at the opportunity,” she says. In 2020, she moved from New York to Bengaluru, where she continues to manage the firm’s databases for its institutional securities businesses and to champion the development of technology and operational innovations. She is a member of the India Technology Management Committee, which oversees the firm’s technology operations in the region, and sponsors the India Tech Diversity Council.  Last year also marked another highlight, as Eldam was named a Morgan Stanley Distinguished Engineer, joining an elite group of technologists who have been recognized inside and outside the firm as influencers with superior technical expertise and mentors to the next generation.
What is your background?
I’m originally from Beirut and am the youngest of eleven children. I finished high school at 16 years old and then started college to study architecture. About a year later, during the civil war in Lebanon in 1988, I immigrated to the U.S with my sisters. By that time, several of my brothers and my mother were already living in the US. I transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles, where I switched my major to computer science, with a minor in math.
After graduation, I became a consultant on state government financial systems. I moved around a lot in the US, including to Hawaii and the Virgin Islands, which was not bad at all! In 1999, I decided I wanted to move to New York and got a call from Morgan Stanley. I’ve been with the firm ever since and have never looked back.
What are some accomplishments you’re proudest of?
I returned to software development at the firm in the wake of the financial crisis. It was an incredibly chaotic time, but also a time of great opportunity. I helped develop a first-of-its-kind bi-temporal data store, which allowed me to establish a framework to manage databases from an application rather than a system perspective. I started building  a team that has grown now to manage the majority of Institutional data stores in the firm.
You have been very active in promoting diversity within the industry. What are some projects you’ve worked on and why is diversity so important?
Diversity not only powers innovation, but it also
makes for a much richer experience for all of us. I’ve been very fortunate to work for Morgan Stanley. We have an amazing culture here. I’ve always had a voice and a seat at the table. But I know not everyone is as lucky. If you have the means to change things more broadly, you should do something.
In the U.S., I started with a colleague of mine the LGBTQ+ working group in Technology for Morgan Stanley North America and co-led the Women in Technology (WIT) Steering Committee. I have also been very active around AnitaB.org, a global organization for Women Technologists, helping to initiate our sponsorship and working closely with campus recruiting to elevate our participation in Grace Hopper Celebration, an annual event that showcases women’s contributions to the world of tech.
What interesting projects are you focusing on right now?
Being a technologist in the financial industry allows me to use innovative tools and systems to solve problems that have huge implications firm-wide. I’m working on a few projects related to moving some of our transactional and reference data to the cloud. This will open up innovative opportunities where we can start utilizing some vendor products and tools that are only available in the cloud. As the data is sensitive, we are making sure that data governance and data security are taken care of appropriately as part of the new architecture and data store choices.
The focus on data has grown tremendously in the last few years. We need to make sure that we have proper data governance, quality, lineage, and most importantly, the levels of security around it. This is an exciting time for technologists who are passionate about data.
What advice do you give most often to people who are starting out in their careers or interested in advancing at the firm?
I always tell people that mobility opens different doors. During my time at Morgan Stanley, I’ve worked with the back office, middle office and front office. Suddenly, there is this light bulb that goes on, and you realize you know so much about the flow between the systems within our firm. That understanding was enormously helpful to me when I worked on data flows that required front-to-back business knowledge, and it was critical to the business in order to achieve federal certification. It’s also been invaluable in supporting collaboration with colleagues.

Navigating Real Estate & Homeownership
Oct 10, 2024
Mortgage rates are forecast to drop, but affordability likely won’t return to pre-pandemic levels. Here’s what that means for buyers, sellers, investors and policymakers.

Your home may be, in some ways, your most complicated financial asset. You might have sentimental attachments to the place where you have raised your family, renovated to your ideal vision or simply made years’ worth of memories.
But for many people, their home is also their primary source of wealth. That means the equity in their home is a key part of their financial plan if they are buying a new property, helping loved ones pay for their educations or funding retirement and healthcare costs.
What’s more, the state of the real estate market is not just important to homeowners. Investors consider both the residential and commercial real estate markets to determine what makes sense in their portfolios, while the equitable availability of housing is a widespread societal issue.
In Morgan Stanley’s wrap-up of the latest real estate trends, we’re looking at strategies for would-be buyers in today’s market, as well as opportunities for investors. Learn more below.

Differences between a brokerage and an investment advisory relationship:
You should understand the differences between a brokerage and advisory relationship. When providing you brokerage services, our legal obligations to you are governed by the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the rules of self‐regulatory organizations such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and state securities laws, where applicable. When providing you advisory services, our legal obligations to you are governed by the Investment Advisers Act and applicable state securities laws. These latter advisory obligations govern our conduct and disclosure requirements, creating a legal standard which is referred to as a “fiduciary” duty to you. Please call the help desk if you have questions about your rights and our obligations to you, including the extent of our obligations to disclose conflicts of interest and to act in your best interest.

AI Earns Its Keep
Mar 12, 2025
Beyond the technology industry, companies from diverse segments are seeing positive results of their investments in artificial intelligence and trying to leverage those benefits into stronger financial performance.
Key Takeaways
Company executives are optimistic about the results of their investments in AI, with forecasts of hundreds of millions of dollars of gains in the next few years.
AI is helping companies to reduce costs, better develop their product and services and to reach customers more efficiently.
Despite the enthusiasm, companies are under pressure to move fast and to choose projects that will be produce positive returns in the long term.
“Monetization” was one of the most frequently spoken words during
Morgan Stanley’s 2025 Technology, Media & Telecom Conference in San Francisco
.
After several years of heavy investment in artificial intelligence, companies are starting to see the benefits of the technology. The technology companies that offer AI solutions are optimistic about their prospects for
revenue and return on investment
. But in technology and beyond, the corporate leaders who attended the conference spoke to AI’s potential to aid in cost reduction, product development and broader customer reach, as well their own ability to leverage those benefits into stronger financial results.
“Software vendors can monetize the ability of GenAI products to bring new productivity gains for their end customers,” said Keith Weiss, who leads U.S. Software Research at Morgan Stanley.
Morgan Stanley Research estimates that AI-driven productivity could add 30 basis points to 2025 net margins for members of the S&P 500.
“Getting AI to work at an enterprise scale is very hard, but I’m finally seeing some signs of it. I am much more optimistic than before,” said the CEO of a large transportation tech company. “Over the next two to three years, we’re going to see hundreds of millions of dollars of benefits.”
This evolution hasn’t been lost on investors. “AI adopters are already outperforming the broader market,” said Andrew Pauker, Morgan Stanley Research U.S. Equity Strategist. “Companies discussing AI adoption have been rewarded in fourth-quarter earnings.”
Returns on investments are appearing in different ways. Here are three areas:
1.     Cost Reductions
Companies are increasingly adopting “agentics,” an AI assistant with some level of autonomy to make decisions and take actions in some specific contexts. Agentics are trained, for example, to analyze inventory data and make necessary adjustments in response to changes in demand.
In contact centers, agentics can answer customer questions and act to resolve issues related to technical operation, delivery or payment. It’s a powerful tool to reduce labor costs and accelerate processes.
The CEO of a telecommunications company noted that customers are already calling contact centers less because AI not only addresses issues more efficiently, but it also improves service quality.
“Having fewer client calls reduces costs,” the executive said. “Good customer experience is good for the expense line.”
2.     Product Development
Because of its capacity to quickly process large amounts of data, AI is a powerful tool to find the best solutions in product development.
The head of an AI software company spoke about how models are being applied in different phases of drug development, from research to trials. According to the executive, AI models have a much higher capacity than humans to cross-reference complex biological data and find accurate solutions. Processes in drug development that traditionally take months could be
resolved in minutes
.
3.     Customer Reach
Media companies are using AI to get a fast and detailed reading of customer behaviors and preferences. With that information, AI can personalize messages to boost engagement with content, including pitching the subscription of a product. That can be done in any part of the world and in different languages.
AI’s ability to provide precise data on consumer trends is also boosting marketing and advertising efficiency. AI tools can adjust the product or service to what customers want at a specific time and then to develop campaigns that will better resonate with the target audience.
Challenges Still Exist
Despite the enthusiasm, executives are challenged to act fast. Monetizing AI is a competitive race, in which both traditional companies and startups are rushing to identify opportunities and adjust their investments.
Investing in projects that can be valuable in the long term is another challenge that emerges for executives. The CFO of a big hardware company noted that, despite the urgency to proceed with those investments, datacenters can’t be built overnight.
“We have to see AI as a durable asset,” the executive said at the conference. “We need to make sure that the results of AI investments are sellable and that we’re building a portfolio that will improve our returns in the long term.”
The Chief Product Officer of a social media company mentioned a third challenge, which is typical in any technology innovation cycle: over excitement.
The executive cited the example of projects for autonomous vehicles, about 20 years ago. At that time, many investors believed that the technology would be ready for use in about three to five years. But to this day, the use of autonomous vehicles is not yet widespread.
“Sometimes it will take it longer than people expect to see the results,” the CPO said. “We need to be patient.”

Four Standout Investment Themes for 2025
Jan 22, 2025
Deglobalization, the continued evolution of AI, longevity and the future of energy could provide investment opportunities in the years ahead.
Author
Michael Zezas
Key Takeaways
Morgan Stanley’s four major investment themes for 2025 offer investors a roadmap for investing for long-term growth.
Three of Morgan Stanley’s megatrends—artificial intelligence, longevity and the future of energy—carry over from last year.
The rewiring of the global economy—returns to our list after a hiatus in 2024, as global policymakers signal a shift in priorities.
Short-term trends can offer investors valuable insights into immediate market dynamics. But it’s the long-term trends that truly shape the investment landscape. That’s why each year, Morgan Stanley Research presents a list of key megatrends that we believe will provide a foundation for sustainable growth and resilience in an ever-changing world.
2025 is likely to see a series of market-impacting catalysts, from
slowing rate cuts
and sticky inflation, to geopolitical complexities stemming from
potential tariffs and tax policy changes
. That’s why it’s important to tune into the deeper trends reshaping and driving opportunity well beyond short-term cycles.
Three of Morgan Stanley’s megatrends—
artificial intelligence, longevity, and the
future of energy—carry over from last year. A fourth—
the rewiring of the global economy
—returns to our list after a hiatus in 2024, as global policymakers signal a shift in priorities. While none of these megatrends is new, each has evolved in terms of how it applies to investment strategies.
1. Global Commerce Gets Rewired for a Multipolar World
For decades, integrated global markets created wealth and buoyed economies. But rising geopolitical tensions, supply chain vulnerabilities and economic dependencies are shifting priorities.
Policymakers in the U.S
. and around the world are taking a
new approach to global commerce
—focusing on national and economic security via
less open trade and more local control
over supply chains.
As companies and countries adapt to changing dynamics, we will see some sectors and regions incurring fresh costs to invest in new supply chain and end-market strategies, while others benefit from those investments.
2. Longevity Will Redefine Healthcare and Demographics
Longevity remains a significant theme, but with more emphasis on tracking its effects and understanding how interventions and drugs, such as obesity medications, are helping people live longer. Obesity drugs have proved to be a disruptor on a scale matched by few other pharmaceutical innovations. These treatments have
effects far beyond weight management
, including a 73% reduction in the risk of developing diabetes and a 20% drop in the risk of cardiovascular deaths.
Other
innovations
in the medical and pharmaceutical landscape, such as “smart chemo” (a revolution in cancer treatment targeting that promises safer treatments and
significant market growth
), AI-aided drug discovery and
brain-computer interfaces
continue to improve and expand lives.
As humans live longer, there is also a heightened focus on “healthspan”—the number of years people live free from disease. For example, nutrition plays a key role in promoting healthier, longer lives,
creating opportunities
for companies to develop affordable diets tailored to the health needs of aging. populations.
Indeed, the
ripple effects of an aging population
reach far beyond the medical and pharmaceutical sectors with implications for
housing
,
financial planning
and consumer goods.
3. Shifting Priorities in Energy Accelerate Innovation
It’s increasingly apparent that companies and governments will not meet their ambitious 2030 climate goals due to a number of factors, including policy gaps and supply chain disruptions. As such, in 2025 Morgan Stanley is focusing on the future of energy, looking beyond decarbonization and considering how population growth, weather patterns and consumer behavior all tie into the supply, demand and delivery of energy across geographies.
Power demand from generative AI alone is estimated to increase at an annual average of
70% through 2027
, primarily due to the expansion of data centers. In response, regulated utilities and other power providers are likely to accelerate the development of both
nuclear
and
renewable energy solutions
, as well as advanced storage systems, to meet this escalating demand.
4. AI Moves from Foundations to Early Game-Changing Applications
To say artificial intelligence has been a transformative force in industries, economies and consumers’
daily lives
would be an understatement. In just two years, since the launch of ChatGPT, we’ve seen generative AI transform
creative industries
, education and retail. AI also carries the potential, via humanoid robots, to
transform manufacturing and healthcare
, and has wide-reaching implications for the
workforce
and the broader economy.
Among other developments, 2025 is likely to see profound growth in agentic AI. In this next phase of AI development, software programs gain "agency” by taking action and adapting without explicit human instruction, which could have profound implications for autonomous vehicles, healthcare assistants and cybersecurity.

Regulation Offers a Boost for Banks
Mar 18, 2025
A more favorable U.S. regulatory environment is likely to fuel lending and activity in capital markets, improving the outlook for bank earnings.
Key Takeaways
A more transparent and supportive approach to regulating the banking industry is one of the priorities of the new U.S. presidential administration.
Changes to regulatory agencies and their rules on capital and stress testing are likely to support bank earnings growth.
M&A activity is poised to accelerate in the second half of 2025, fueled by $4 trillion of dry powder from sponsors needing to be deployed and three years of pent-up demand.
Bank regulation in the U.S. is likely to ease or stabilize under the new Trump administration, which could lead to stronger financial results for the industry, according to Morgan Stanley Research.
For the first time since the global financial crisis, which led to turmoil in markets and the economy from 2007 to 2009, banks are expected to face a more favorable regulatory environment. The new framework could boost lending and
activity in capital markets
in the coming years.
Even if the economy slows because of policies related to trade, immigration and government efficiency initiatives, banks should be able to expand. “We expect bank regulators to address decade-old industry asks, shifting from years of increasing difficulty and complexity toward a more transparent, integrated and supportive approach” says Betsy Graseck, Global Head of Banks and Diversified Finance Research at Morgan Stanley. “This is likely to support earnings growth.”
Changes Have Started
Members of President Donald Trump’s cabinet have made it clear that regulatory reform is a central priority. Since the inauguration, the new administration has reversed prior executive actions and initiated new ones to encourage industry growth at several agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has noted the need to “smartly reinvigorate” financial institutions with more “efficient, effective and appropriately tailored” regulation.
1
Proposals to change agencies and rules on capital, liquidity and consumer lending are already under discussion, including:
CFPB
: The administration has taken steps to narrow the agency’s rulemaking and enforcement activity. A more constrained CFPB, with less uncertainty and oversight, could benefit banks, according to Morgan Stanley Research. Previous rules related to credit card late fees, overdraft fees and medical debt are likely to be reversed.
Stress tests
: This tool, which is used to inform regulators and the public how banks would fare under scenarios of extreme stress, could become more transparent in 2025. The Federal Reserve, which conducts the tests, has expressed its intention to take steps soon to reduce the volatility of results and begin to improve transparency.
Basel Endgame
: This is an international effort to create standards for capital requirements after the global financial crisis in 2007-2009. Regulators are expected to agree on a new set of rules after the initial proposal faced opposition. Having a final rule set would provide clarity for banks to fully optimize capital utilization for the first time since the global financial crisis.
M&A to Accelerate This Year
Dealmaking activity is one of the areas likely to help improve the outlook for bank earnings. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the annualized volume of completed M&A relative to nominal gross domestic product (GDP) was 44% below the annual average from 1996 to 2024. Last year there was only a slight improvement from 2023, when completed M&A volumes relative to GDP were at the lowest levels in three decades.
“The slowdown in M&A was driven primarily by macroeconomic uncertainty, including recession fears and sharply rising rates with debate around their end point,” Morgan Stanley Equity Analyst Ryan Kenny says. “However, antitrust enforcement also played a role.”
Companies gave up on deals or kept them on hold because of greater regulatory scrutiny, which increases the cost and time required to complete M&A transactions. New FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson appears supportive of antitrust transparency, recently saying “if you’re not violating the law, the FTC is going to get out of the way.”
2
As boards become more comfortable with the economic outlook and the regulatory environment, Morgan Stanley Research expects M&A announcements to accelerate in the second half of 2025, fueled by three years of pent-up demand and about $4 trillion of sponsor dry powder to be deployed in deals.
Despite business leaders’ optimism around the new administration, activity in U.S. capital markets was still weak in January and February, with M&A fees yet to improve on an annual basis.
“CEOs need time to process the rapid changes coming their way including tariff whiplash, geopolitical developments, regulatory head changes and the impact of federal workforce reductions,” Kenny says. “We are at peak uncertainty now and expect more clarity going forward.”
Banks Poised to Consolidate
The banking industry itself could also be a focus for dealmaking activity. Consolidation has been a prominent theme in the sector for more than 40 years as banks use M&A to become more efficient and competitive.
Also, the U.S. banking system currently encompasses about 4,000 banks, making it one of the most fragmented in the world.
“We think smaller bank M&A deals, among banks with $25 billion in assets and below, will pick up first, likely over the next several months,” Morgan Stanley Midcap Bank Analyst Manan Gosalia says. “Larger deals are likely to follow over the medium term as management teams and boards get more clarity on the regulatory and macroeconomic backdrop.”

How to Invest During a 'Growth Scare'
Mar 5, 2025
The mood in markets is dimming as growth appears to slow, inflation concerns persist and market volatility looms. What does this mean for your investments?
Author
Lisa Shalett
Key Takeaways
A spate of weak economic readings suggests a slowdown, with data falling below expectations and services activity contracting.
Persistent inflation, rising policy uncertainty and a seasonal drop in market liquidity could spell further volatility for financial markets.
Investors should focus on diversification across asset classes and consider alternatives like hedge funds and real assets to help mitigate risks.
It’s hard to believe 2025 is only two months old, given how much has changed. Since the start of the year, many investors have toned down their longstanding optimism as the Federal Reserve signals patience in cutting rates, while investors consider whether
new competitors
in artificial intelligence could undermine the dominance of U.S. tech companies that drove so much of the 2024 gains in U.S. equities.
On top of these developments, a recent spate of weak economic data and falling consumer confidence, alongside rising policy uncertainty, have  sparked a “growth scare” in financial markets. Consider:
The Citi Economic Surprise Index, which tracks the gap between expectations and reality of economic performance, has plummeted to its lowest level since September 2024, indicating data are coming in well below economists’ expectations.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) of activity in the U.S. services sector fell into contraction for the first time in more than two years.
Consumer sentiment has weakened, measured by both the University of Michigan Index and the Conference Board Survey, amid growing concerns over inflation and the economy.
January existing home sales fell month-over-month, the first decline since September 2024.
The Conference Board’s index of leading economic indicators dipped below forecasts.
Amid this downbeat data, the 10-year Treasury yield—a key indicator of investor sentiment about the economy’s future health—has fallen below 4.3%, from about 4.8% in mid-January.
All told, real gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of 2025 could easily slow from last quarter’s reading of 2.3%.
More Challenges Ahead?
The recent economic data don’t necessarily signal a departure from an economic “soft landing,” in which growth gradually slows and inflation recedes. However, these readings are occurring against a backdrop in which three other variables may pose further challenges for investors.
Wealth Management
Vibe Shift
A “growth scare” may be setting in, as weaker economic data and lower consumer confidence combine with rising policy uncertainty. How should investors be positioned?
Share
n/a
1
Persistent Inflation Concerns
Although key inflation metrics are down sharply from their mid-2022 peak, there has been no real incremental progress in recent months. Consumer Price Index (CPI) metrics have been anchored at about 3% for the past seven months, and personal consumption expenditures (PCE) metrics rose in January. Consumers’ inflation expectations are on the rise as well, with the one-year outlook remaining at 4.3% and the five-to-10-year outlook increasing to 3.5%, the highest since 1995, according to the latest University of Michigan survey. Headlines about egg prices topping $8 per dozen due to bird flu are not helping. Importantly, combining higher inflation with slowing growth spells stagflation—typically a scenario that is not good for stocks or bonds.
2
Rising Policy Uncertainty
U.S. policy uncertainty is rising rapidly amid
shifting political winds in Washington, D.C
.—a dynamic that is historically linked to rising market volatility, falling consumer confidence and wider risk premiums (i.e., the additional returns investors expect for taking on riskier investments compared to a risk-free asset). While these spreads are currently low or negative, apparently disconnected from rising policy uncertainty, their potential widening could suggest investors see growing risk of losses ahead.
3
Market Liquidity Challenges
Finally, this is all happening as market liquidity (or the ease with which assets can be quickly bought and sold without major price fluctuations) enters a seasonally weak period as investors liquidate some holdings to pay their taxes. A potential rise in volatility from lower liquidity could be exacerbated by debate in Washington about the debt ceiling, fiscal austerity measures and a new federal budget that includes the extension of 2017 tax cuts. Promises of fiscal austerity, while potentially positive for the long-term debt outlook, may weigh on short-term growth estimates as well.
Considerations for Investors
Given these dynamics, the current growth scare may persist for a while, and investors are perhaps right to be cautious. To be sure, Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee does not think the fundamental foundation for earnings in 2025 has changed yet, but risks are increasing.
Investors should consider the importance of staying at maximum levels of diversification by asset class, sector and geography.
In U.S. equities, avoid the market-cap-weighted benchmark equity index in favor of its equal-weighted counterpart or active management.
Consider adding hedge funds for uncorrelated and more stable potential returns, along with investment-grade credit, high-quality municipal bonds, real assets like gold and residential real estate, and select opportunistic private investments.

Risk Considerations
Equity securities
may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.
Bonds
are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.
Bonds rated below investment grade
may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market.  Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds.  High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.
Interest on
municipal bonds
is generally exempt from federal income tax; however, some bonds may be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Also, municipal bonds acquired in the secondary market at a discount may be subject to the market discount tax provisions, and therefore could give rise to taxable income.  Typically, state tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one’s state of residence and, if applicable, local tax-exemption applies if securities are issued within one’s city of residence. The tax-exempt status of municipal securities may be changed by legislative process, which could affect their value and marketability.
Yields
are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.
Investing in foreign markets
entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. These risks are magnified in countries with
emerging markets and frontier markets
, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.
Alternative investments
may be either traditional alternative investment vehicles, such as hedge funds, fund of hedge funds, private equity, private real estate and managed futures or, non-traditional products such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that also seek alternative-like exposure but have significant differences from traditional alternative investments. The risks of traditional alternative investments may include: can be highly illiquid, speculative and not appropriate for all investors, loss of all or a substantial portion of the investment due to leveraging, short-selling, or other speculative practices, volatility of returns, restrictions on transferring interests in a fund, potential lack of diversification and resulting higher risk due to concentration of trading authority when a single advisor is utilized, absence of information regarding valuations and pricing, complex tax structures and delays in tax reporting, less regulation and higher fees than open-end mutual funds, and risks associated with the operations, personnel and processes of the manager. Non-traditional alternative strategy products may employ various investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and more speculative purposes such as short-selling, leverage, derivatives and options, which can increase volatility and the risk of investment loss. These investments are subject to the risks normally associated with debt instruments and also carry substantial additional risks. Investors could lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. These investments typically have higher fees or expenses than traditional investments.
Hedge funds
may involve a high degree of risk, often engage in leveraging and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss, can be highly illiquid, are not required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures and delays in distributing important tax information, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements as mutual funds, often charge high fees which may offset any trading profits, and in many cases the underlying investments are not transparent and are known only to the investment manager.
REITs
investing
risks are similar to those associated with direct investments in real estate: property value fluctuations, lack of liquidity, limited diversification and sensitivity to economic factors such as interest rate changes and market recessions
Investing in commodities
entails significant risks. Commodity prices may be affected by a variety of factors at any time, including but not limited to, (i) changes in supply and demand relationships, (ii) governmental programs and policies, (iii) national and international political and economic events, war and terrorist events, (iv) changes in interest and exchange rates, (v) trading activities in commodities and related contracts, (vi) pestilence, technological change and weather, and (vii) the price volatility of a commodity. In addition, the commodities markets are subject to temporary distortions or other disruptions due to various factors, including lack of liquidity, participation of speculators and government intervention.
Physical precious metals
are non-regulated products. Precious metals are speculative investments, which may experience short-term and long-term price volatility. The value of precious metals investments may fluctuate and may appreciate or decline, depending on market conditions. If sold in a declining market, the price you receive may be less than your original investment. Unlike bonds and stocks, precious metals do not make interest or dividend payments. Therefore, precious metals may not be appropriate for investors who require current income. Precious metals are commodities that should be safely stored, which may impose additional costs on the investor. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) provides certain protection for customers’ cash and securities in the event of a brokerage firm’s bankruptcy, other financial difficulties, or if customers’ assets are missing. SIPC insurance does not apply to precious metals or other commodities.
Because of their narrow focus,
sector investments
tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.
Technology stocks
may be especially volatile.
Asset allocation and diversification
do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.
Value investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.
Growth investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria.

A Shared Past, a Common Purpose

These three employees, alums of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, are helping the firm support the next generation of Black students through our Morgan Stanley HBCU Scholars Program.
Alita Wingfield, Leon Henderson, Jr. and Nii Dodoo aren’t just colleagues at Morgan Stanley. They share the common bond of having graduated from a Historically Black College or University (HBCU) and—as employee ambassadors of our
HBCU Scholars
program—of continuing their commitment to those schools and their students long after they graduated.
Wingfield, a Managing Director in the Legal and Compliance division and the Head of the firm’s Compliance training program, attended Spelman College as an undergraduate and Howard University Law School. Henderson, a Managing Director in Wealth Management, holds a degree in architecture from Howard University, as well as an MBA from Harvard Business School. And Dodoo, an Executive Director in the Fixed Income Division, graduated from Morehouse College with a double major in finance and math and a minor in computer science.
All three say the experience of attending one or more of the HBCUs, 101 institutions across the country that were established before the civil rights movement to serve the African-American community, was transformative in ways they couldn’t imagine finding at any other college. “My son attends Harvard, but I was actually more excited when my daughter got into Spelman,” Wingfield says. “You leave there feeling like you can really conquer the world. I would not be the person I am today without Spelman and Howard.”
Growing the Legacy
Given their deep bonds to HBCUs, including spouses and children who also attended, it’s not surprising that all three serve on a group that oversees the
Morgan Stanley HBCU Scholars Program
. Launched in 2020, through Morgan Stanley’s
Institute for Inclusion
, the program offers full scholarships to qualified students attending Howard, Morehouse and Spelman. Additionally, it trains students in career skills to help set them on a life-long path to success.
Morgan Stanley began the program by providing five academic and needs-based four-year scholarships at each institution, with the goal of adding a new class of scholars each year for a class size of 60 by 2024. The scholarships cover the entire cost of attending the institution for each academic year and are open to students across all disciplines and majors.
Offering a Chance at New Career Paths
Henderson, whose daughter chose to attend Howard over other top universities, says that the firm’s HBCU alums have a practical, as well as emotional, reason to get involved: Many remain connected to their alma maters throughout their careers.  “A lot of us are already in touch with HBCUs, particularly around the effort to hire graduates to join our teams, so I give credit to the firm—I think it was a good call to have us work on this initiative.”
And, while the scholarships come with no strings attached—students are free to pursue whatever field they wish to after graduation—the three hope that the program will open a world of possibilities at Morgan Stanley for those who may not have otherwise considered a career in the financial industry.
“To provide greater exposure to students who don’t know about our industry is something that I’m very excited about,” says Wingfield, who notes that the financial sector as a whole could use more bright and talented Black graduates, like the ones who will be part of the Morgan Stanley HBCU Scholar program. “It’s an opportunity for us to recruit more diverse candidates and to get more diverse people interested in our industry, which lacks diversity in many different areas,” says Henderson.
Supporting the HBCU mission
Wingfield, Henderson and Dodoo also welcome the chance to support the schools themselves, which they believe offer Black students a unique experience. “To have professors who look like you, who truly care about your success, and other students who look like you, who are dealing with the same struggle and the same challenges is invaluable,” Wingfield says.
Dodoo agrees. “The experience [of attending Morehouse] was unbelievable. I was with a group of highly talented people who could relate to me. But beyond that, the small class size, the teachers who were invested in every student, the powerful alumni network—those were things my friends at other schools didn’t necessarily have. To this day, the Morehouse alum who helped me land my first job in banking, holding my hand throughout the interview process, is like a brother to me.”
Dodoo joined the HBCU Ambassador team in early 2022 and says the day he interviewed students for the program’s latest cohort brought tears to his eyes. “Hearing how some of them didn’t know how they were going to be able to afford to continue their education and knowing how we could make a difference—I got emotional. I don’t know of another program that has this sort of profound impact on the lives of young people.”
He and his colleagues hope to continue to make that difference as the program expands into its third year and beyond. Says Wingfield, “As long as I’m at Morgan Stanley, I’ll be on the HBCU working group, constantly thinking about how to engage these students and how to make the program even bigger and better.” Dodoo hopes to one day welcome some of those students to Morgan Stanley himself.  “I could easily see not just one or two students but several of them working alongside me. As I see it, it’s not just likely, it’s highly likely.”

7 Political Trends Investors Should Watch in 2025
Jan 21, 2025
Discover how the top policy changes coming out of Washington may affect the economy, markets and your portfolio.
Author
Monica Guerra, Head of Policy, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
Author
Daniel Kohen, U.S. Policy Strategist, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
Key Takeaways
Most individual and corporate tax rules from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are likely to be extended; however, further corporate tax cuts may be difficult to achieve.
While Congress is expected to raise the U.S. debt limit, concerns about the growing debt may slow GOP policy goals.
Stiffer tariffs could dent stocks in U.S. industries where firms mainly manufacture goods overseas and depend on U.S. imports.
Lower rates may boost the clean energy industry, while conflicting policy shifts could potentially hurt healthcare stocks.
Restrictive immigration policies could reduce U.S. consumer spending and workforce availability, slowing growth.
With a new Republican-led White House and Congress, 2025 is set to bring shifts in U.S. government policy that may affect the economy and financial markets. Here are some of the top policy and regulatory actions to watch for, along with what it may mean for your investment portfolio.
1
Most Individual tax rules are likely to be extended
Key provisions from President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act affecting individuals are set to expire at the end of 2025, including changes to individual income tax rates, the standard deduction, personal exemptions, the alternative minimum tax and estate taxes. Should the provisions expire, it is estimated to increase taxes for approximately 62% of tax filers.
Investor implications:
Tax policy will be a central element for the first year of President Trump’s agenda. Expect a unified Congress to extend most of the expiring provisions, with lawmakers potentially incorporating other tax breaks that may spur the economy. These could include an increase in (or even elimination of) the current $10,000 state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap as well as a time-limited tax holiday for tips and overtime.
2
Corporate tax cuts could be limited
During his first term, President Trump cut the corporate income tax rate from as high as 35% to a permanent 21% flat rate. While he has proposed lower rates, a swelling federal deficit and a potential need to offset other tax cuts may lead Congress to maintain the current 21% corporate tax rate.
Investor implications:
Flat or rising corporate income taxes could disappoint financial markets hoping for a corporate tax cut. However, any possible tax increases would likely be limited, such as targeting U.S. multinational companies to incentivize them to “reshore” operations in the U.S.
3
Debt-ceiling debates may stall the GOP agenda
The government reached its federal debt limit of $36 trillion earlier this year, and will likely need to lift or suspend the debt ceiling in the next few months. Federal lawmakers have lifted or suspended the debt limit more than 20 times since 2002; thanks to unified control of Congress and the White House, the GOP should be able to raise the debt ceiling once again.
Investor implications:
While we do not expect the U.S. to default on its debt, upcoming debt-ceiling negotiations may be entangled with lawmakers’ concerns about growing government debt and deficits, ultimately slowing the GOP’s progress on broader policy goals, such as tax reform. This could delay any potential economic benefit from such reforms while creating investor uncertainty.

Tariffs will likely add to stock-specific risk
During the 2024 campaign, President Trump proposed aggressive tariffs on Chinese, Canadian and Mexican goods. While we expect the proposal to be used as a negotiating tactic, if enacted the tariffs would likely
increase U.S. inflation and negatively impact productivity
.
Investor implications:
Specific industries and sectors are particularly exposed to tariff risk, such as businesses that primarily manufacture goods overseas and depend on U.S. imports for revenue.
Even the threat of tariffs can impact stock prices. For example, a Morgan Stanley index of tariff-exposed stocks
1
rallied based on former Vice President Harris’s solid debate performance last fall in anticipation of a Harris win and the continuation of current tariffs. However, the index immediately sold off after President Trump’s November electoral victory in anticipation of increased tariffs.
5
Clean energy may outperform traditional energy
While the new administration’s policies may create headwinds for the industry, roughly 80% of the funds obligated through the Inflation Reduction Act have benefited GOP-controlled states and districts, potentially reducing congressional willingness to unwind clean energy incentives. Not only that, but new policies that increase oil drilling could drive traditional energy prices downward amid already-elevated supply.
Investor implications:
While it may sound counterintuitive, clean energy outperformed during President Trump’s first term, when rates were lower, while underperforming under President Biden, when rates were higher and geopolitical risks were elevated. With two Federal Reserve rate cuts expected in 2025, rate-sensitive clean energy stocks could get another boost.
6
Policy shifts may hurt the healthcare sector
Healthcare is likely to be a focal point for the incoming administration, with pharmaceuticals, managed care beneficiaries and other insurance companies negatively affected due to the potential for less-stringent vaccine mandates reducing demand, as well as for further weakening of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related subsidies.
Investor implications:
These circumstances, along with greater scrutiny of pharmaceutical development and a stricter approval process from the FDA, could drag on pharmaceutical market performance. In addition, Congress is expected to let enhanced ACA subsidies expire at the end of 2025, which could significantly increase premium payments for some policyholders.
7
Immigration curbs could slow the economy
Restrictive immigration policies under the new administration may include more aggressive deportation plans, expansion of the border wall, increased funding for the Department of Homeland Security, elimination of programs like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and reevaluation of visa and asylum seeker programs. Such changes could significantly reduce immigration as soon as mid-2025.
Investor implications:
Fewer immigrants can mean fewer people buying goods and being available to work. For example, reinstatement of the “Remain in Mexico” policy for asylum seekers could reduce net migration from 1.1 million people to about 800,000 annually, according to Oxford Economics, causing GDP to fall by 0.5% in the first five years. Additional immigration restrictions could create a further drag on consumer spending and productivity, especially as the U.S. population ages and birth rates fall.
The Bottom Line
Ultimately, we expect a slower pace for Republican policy goals, such as broad tax cuts and swift budget negotiations, than what was promised on the campaign trail. Against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, U.S. policies around tariffs, immigration and deregulation, could affect sectors like health care and energy. This could add greater uncertainty for investors in 2025.

Equity securities
may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.
Growth investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.
Value investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.
International investing
entails greater risk, as well as greater potential rewards compared to U.S. investing. These risks include political and economic uncertainties of foreign countries as well as the risk of currency fluctuations. These risks are magnified in countries with
emerging markets and frontier markets
since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) investments
in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices.  Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers.  Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.
Because of their narrow focus,

An HIV/AIDS Advocacy Organization Gets Some Healthy Advice

A New York nonprofit supporting LGBT+ Latinos received a winning strategy assessment through Morgan Stanley’s signature pro bono program.
Visit the community center run by the Latino Commission on AIDS (LCOA) in New York City’s Chelsea neighborhood and you are struck by two powerful images. One is a tribute to the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, FL, in 2016—the largest mass shooting targeting LGBT+ Latinos in U.S. history. The second is a memorial to the growing number of Latino transgender people who have been murdered in recent years.
The wall hangings are powerful reminders of the community served by the nonprofit, which was established in 1990 as a membership organization to address the HIV/AIDS crisis among Latinos. Its mission includes spearheading health advocacy for Latinos, promoting HIV education, developing model prevention programs for high-risk communities, and building capacity in community organizations. LCOA helps fill a large need: social stigma, poverty, language barriers, lack of access to care, and immigration status combine to deter HIV testing among Latinos, leading to increased infection rates. What’s more, some 22% of the population is without health insurance. The problem has become even more urgent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, says Guillermo Chacón, president of LCOA. “The painful lesson we learned from the past two-plus years is how essential it is to invest in prevention,” he says.
LCOA had already done some preliminary work on a plan to provide primary healthcare as part of its offerings, but to further explore this initiative, LCOA’s leadership turned to Morgan Stanley, whose Strategy Challenge pro bono program matches non-profits with rising talent within the firm to help them address key strategic issues. The ten-week program culminates in a presentation to a panel of judges, colleagues and Morgan Stanley leaders who name a winning team.

Predicting Depression in Teens
Identifying a Need
The Morgan Stanley team representing LCOA—one of nine total U.S. teams—began its work by interviewing members of the LCOA staff, who explained how critical the need for primary care has become. “Their clients were begging for it,” says Ariana Salvatore, a member of the team and an Associate in Morgan Stanley’s Fixed Income Research division. “The staff identified this as the number one additional service they could offer their community.”
The team then interviewed potential medical partners and community organizations, working to develop a model to determine the financial impact of offering primary care. They assessed how much capital would be needed, what sort of staffing would be required, and what income LCOA could reasonably expect from treating primary care patients.
An Unexpected Conclusion
After conducting extensive analysis, the team concluded that offering primary care was not financially feasible for LCOA at this time. The major impediment: treating Medicaid patients would not yield enough revenue to cover LCOA’s costs. The organization would need to cut costs by reducing staff—but that was not a realistic plan, either. In fact, additional staffing would be needed in order for LCOA to offer primary care, along with a more robust technology platform. Adding private paying patients might enhance profitability, but the team concluded this was not a viable option given the population LCOA serves.
It wasn't easy for the Strategy Challenge team to recommend postponing LCOA's expansion plans, knowing how determined the organization was to find a means of offering primary care. “They were pretty far down the road of pursuing this opportunity when we began working with them,” says team member Mary Kelly, a Vice President in the Investment Banking Division’s Global Power and Utilities Group. “So, it was tough to share our conclusions. But they responded really positively and were grateful to us for offering honest advice.”
“We were so impressed with the Morgan Stanley team’s culture of humility, how they took the time to deeply understand our mission over those ten weeks,” says Chacón. “I mentioned to each of them that they left their fingerprints on our DNA for years to come.”
A Path Forward
Despite their reservations about LCOA’s plans to offer primary care, the Strategy Challenge team, which also included John Eric Tengco, Vice President, Finance, along with a Managing Director advisor, felt strongly that they needed to leave the organization with a path forward. The team found a consultant to non-profits called Primary Care Development Corporation (PCDC), which offered LCOA twenty hours of pro bono consulting time. In addition, says Chacón, it advised LCOA to look to interim solutions while continuing to explore the feasibility of on-site primary care, such as mobile care vans and telehealth services.
For the Morgan Stanley team members who worked with LCOA, the experience drew on skills that will serve them well in their careers, says Salvatore: “Working on the Strategy Challenge opened my eyes to the non-profit world. It was so interesting to use the skills we developed during our ‘day’ jobs to benefit others. And it furthered my perspective on Morgan Stanley, where our diversity of thought enables us to come up with impactful solutions, whether for clients or to those serving our communities.”

Understanding Private Credit

Private credit, which can offer floating interest rates that increase in tandem with benchmark rates, has seen significant growth in recent years and could become a $2.8 trillion market by 2028. See how.
Demand for private credit—which refers to lending to companies by institutions other than banks—has grown significantly in recent years. Unlike most bank loans, private credit solutions can be tailored to meet borrowers’ needs in terms of size, type or timing of transactions. Similar to bank loans, however, the majority of private credit lending is in the form of floating-rate investments that change as rates change, providing real-time interest rate mitigation compared to investments like fixed-rate bonds.
In addition, amid recession fears and tighter bank lending, private credit offers borrowers pricing certainty and speed, which has helped fuel the market’s growth in recent years. The size of the private credit market at the start of 2024 was approximately $1.5 trillion, compared to approximately $1 trillion in 2020, and is estimated to grow to $2.8 trillion by 2028.

Ashwin Krishnan, Co-Head of North America Private Credit at
Morgan Stanley Investment Management
, explains the different types of private credit, the growing appetite for the asset class and how private credit has behaved in prior market cycles.
Q: What is private credit and what are the different types?
Krishnan:
Private credit is a form of lending outside of the traditional banking system, in which lenders work directly with borrowers to negotiate and originate privately held loans that are not traded in public markets. Following the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008, and the associated capital rules for banks, private credit has filled a lending void.
There are generally four common types of private credit
2
:
Direct Lending:
Direct lending strategies provide credit primarily to private, non-investment-grade companies. Direct lending strategies may be appealing as they invest in the senior-most part of a company’s capital structure, which may provide steady current income with relatively lower risk.
Mezzanine, Second Lien Debt and Preferred Equity:
These three forms of credit, collectively known as “junior capital,” provide borrowers with subordinated debt. This kind of instrument is not secured by assets and ranks below more senior loans for repayment in the event of a default or bankruptcy. Junior capital often comes with equity “kickers,” which are incentives that can support attractive total returns—often on par with equities—while still being a debt claim in the payment waterfall.
Distressed Debt:
When companies enter financial distress, they work with existing distressed debt investors to improve their prospects through operational turnarounds and balance sheet restructuring. Distressed debt is highly specialized and the prevalence of opportunities tends to coincide with economic downturns and periods of credit tightness. These lenders take on a higher level of risk in exchange for lower prices and potentially high returns.
Special Situations:
Special situations can mean any variety of non-traditional corporate event that requires a high degree of customization and complexity. This may include companies undergoing M&A transactions or other capital events, divestitures or spinoffs, or similar situations that are driving their borrowing needs.
Q: What is the role of private credit in a portfolio?
Krishnan:
Investors have increasingly added private credit to their portfolios as a potentially higher-yielding alternative to traditional fixed-income strategies. It can potentially include the following:
Current income:
Like traditional fixed income, private credit generally offers the possibility for current income from contractual cash flows (i.e., interest payments and fees).
Illiquidity premium:
Private credit may provide a yield spread above public corporate bonds to compensate for the “illiquid” or non-tradeable nature of the investments.
Historically lower loss rates:
Private credit has demonstrated lower loss rates relative to public credit over time.
Diversification:
Private credit has been less correlated with public markets than other asset classes, such as equities and bonds. This can help reduce portfolio volatility and improve risk-adjusted returns.
Customized portfolio construction:
It may be possible to create highly customized portfolios of strategies to blend risk-adjusted returns across a variety of private-credit strategies.
Q: How have returns for private credit compared to those of traditional fixed-income investments?
Krishnan:
Private credit has historically offered compelling performance in relation to other segments of the fixed-income market. Since the global financial crisis, when private credit began growing in earnest, direct lending (the most common type of private credit) has provided higher returns and lower volatility compared to both leveraged loans and high-yield bonds.

In particular, direct lending has outperformed in high and rising rate environments. When measured over seven different periods of high interest rates between the first quarter of 2008 and the third quarter of 2023, direct lending yielded average returns of 11.6%, compared with 5% for leveraged loans and 6.8% for high-yield bonds.

Private credit may also offer better mitigation against losses, having demonstrated relative resiliency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Between the outbreak of COVID and the third quarter of 2023, direct lending sustained losses of 1.1%, compared with losses of 1.3% for leveraged loans and 2.2% for high-yield bonds.

Q: Where do you see opportunities in the private credit market?
Krishnan:
We see the potential for opportunities in the following areas:
Providing junior capital and hybrid capital solutions, as today’s “higher for longer” interest-rate environment constrains fundamentally-sound businesses with higher cash debt service requirements and lower levels of senior debt capacity. Junior capital can help relieve those fixed obligations and allow companies to pursue accretive organic and inorganic growth initiatives.
Extending credit to high-quality growth companies. In the wake of rising benchmark rates, many equity investors reoriented their focus away from “growth at any cost” enterprises and toward stable, profitable companies. Consequently, the availability of growth capital for ramping, high-quality businesses—many with best-in-class KPIs—dried up. There is an opportunity to fill this gap in a way that allows high-quality companies to re-invest earnings at attractive incremental returns with minimal equity dilution, while generating attractive returns for the investor.
Rescue-financing capital, should the economy enter into a recession or high-default environment.
Q: What are the key considerations for private debt in a difficult macroeconomic environment?
Krishnan:
A proactive approach has become increasingly important, which includes closely analyzing companies’ earnings and free cash-flow generation in light of the current economic and interest-rate environment.
Meanwhile, for companies, the primary focus is liquidity management. Borrowing costs have increased significantly over the last 18 months, as loans are a floating-rate product. To date, the vast majority of borrowers in the market have been able to successfully manage their liquidity.

Are You Prepared for Tax Day?
Jan 13, 2025
The countdown to Tax Day has begun. Here are some strategies to consider as the deadline approaches.
Key Takeaways
April 15, 2025, is generally the deadline to file your 2024 taxes with the IRS.
Organize your tax documents early to avoid mistakes and identify every deduction available to you.
Max out your retirement and health-savings accounts before the deadline to help lower your tax bill.
Consider working with your financial professional to incorporate tax-smart strategies into your investment plan to help you save more for your goals.
It should come as no surprise that many Americans take a dim view of paying taxes.
1
Still, the saying coined by Ben Franklin more than 200 years ago—“Nothing is certain except death and taxes”—rings true today: Taxes are inevitable.
The sooner you get started, the better prepared you’ll be.
As the April 15 federal income tax filing and payment deadline approaches, it may be helpful to review Morgan Stanley’s
2024
and
2025
Federal Income Tax Tables, and if you haven’t already filed, consider these six tax season tips:
1
Get Your Paperwork Organized
Tax time, unfortunately, can involve a mountain of paperwork. Make sure you have all your important documents ready before you begin filing, so you can avoid mistakes and take advantage of every deduction available to you.
The IRS will start accepting returns in early 2025.
2
The documents you may need to file a complete and accurate return include:
Forms W-2, Forms 1099-NEC (for contract work) and other tax forms showing income earned
Records of charitable contributions
Previous-year tax returns
Records of mortgage interest and property taxes paid
Any childcare expenses or medical costs
Social Security numbers for yourself, your spouse (if filing jointly) and any dependents
A tax organizer, if you’re working with a tax pro that provides one
Work with your tax professional to determine the specific documents you’ll need to complete your tax return. It’s important to note that if you’ve changed your address or name in the past year, you’ll want to let the IRS and the Social Security Administration know.
2
Max Out Tax-Advantaged Accounts Before Tax Day
The 2024 tax year ended December 31, but you still have time before Tax Day 2025 to max out some of your accounts and reduce your taxable income. For example, the deadline to contribute to an individual retirement account (IRA) or a
health savings account
(HSA) for the 2024 tax year is generally April 15, 2025. That means you may still be able to put more funds in these accounts—up to the IRS 2024 maximums of:
IRA:
$7,000, plus $1,000 in catch-up contributions if you’re 50 or older at any time during the 2024 calendar year.
3
HSA:
$4,150 for single coverage ($8,300 for family coverage) under a high deductible health plan, and another $1,000 if you’re 55 or older at any time during the 2024 calendar year.
4
What about your employer-sponsored 401(k) plan? The window to contribute the IRS maximum to this type of account for the 2024 tax year closed for many employees on December 31, 2024. However, for the 2025 tax year you can contribute up to $23,500, as well as a $7,500 catch-up contribution if you’re age 50 and over at any time during the 2025 calendar year. The $7,500 catch-up amount increases to $11,250 if you’re age 60 to 63.
5
So, if you are continuing to build your nest egg, consider saving more now. It can help you reduce your taxable income for 2025 tax filing purposes.
Note, however, that additional contribution and eligibility limitations may apply, meaning the maximum amount you may be able to contribute to an IRA, HSA or 401(k) plan may be less than the IRS maximums stated above. You should speak to a qualified tax advisor for more information on the applicable contribution rules.
3
Consider Getting Help from a Tax Professional
If your financial situation has grown more complex or you simply prefer some assistance, consider working with a qualified professional at tax time. A tax professional can help you:
Gather the right tax and financial data from your investment accounts
Take advantage of any deductions or credits you’re entitled to
Prepare your income tax returns
Share advice tailored to your unique financial situation
A tax professional can also provide you with income tax projections, including quarterly estimated payments, reducing the risk of unwanted surprises if your tax situation changes. Further, if you have complex tax planning needs, your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor can connect you to experienced tax professionals at leading providers across the country to help optimize your tax strategy.

Plan for Future Tax Seasons
It’s never too late to start incorporating tax-efficient strategies into your longer-term financial plan. Year-round, active tax management may help you save more for goals and keep more of what you’ve earned. For example:
Tax-loss harvesting
is a strategy where you offset federal income taxes on net capital gains via a strategic sale of stock or securities to recognize capital losses, some of which can carry over from a prior year.
6
Excess capital losses may also be used to offset ordinary income up to $3,000 per year ($1,500 if married filing separately).
Tax-aware asset location
involves
allocating higher-yield assets to a tax-deferred or tax-exempt account, which may help decrease your current federal taxable income and may help increase your after-tax returns.
Tax-favorable investment options
,
such as municipal bonds, are generally exempt from federal (and, in some cases, state and local) taxes. Also consider tax-efficient exchange-traded funds or separately managed accounts.
With
Morgan Stanley Total Tax 365
, your Financial Advisor has access to a range of tax-smart techniques to help you manage your tax liability and grow your long-term wealth, 365 days a year. Speak with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor about how you can incorporate tax-efficient investment strategies into your financial plan today to help you prepare for tomorrow.
5
If You Owe Money, Consider How You'll Pay
If, instead of a refund, you end up owing the IRS money, you’ll want to have a plan. If you have the cash and don’t want to risk draining your savings or emergency funds, writing a check may be the easiest option.
If you have a steep tax bill, you may want to look for additional sources of liquidity. One approach is selling individual securities or funds in your portfolio to help raise the cash you need. Be aware of the downsides, including potential income taxes on capital gains, loss of future growth potential and asset-allocation imbalances in your portfolio. Your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor can help you mitigate these downsides and potentially reduce the taxes you may owe, using
our Intelligent Withdrawals tool
.
Using a credit card, taking out a loan or paying the IRS in installments are among the other options—each with its own pros and cons. Be sure to think ahead about which payment method may work best for you.
6
Think About How You’ll Spend a Refund
If you received a refund last year, you may be looking forward to another one in 2025. Instead of spending it all outright, you may want to consider how to use it to support your long-term financial well-being, for example by:
Reducing your debt burden:
If you’re paying high interest charges on a credit card balance or a consumer loan, it can be difficult to save for longer-term financial goals. Consider using your tax refund to help service your balances with the highest interest charges while paying the minimum on lower-rate debt.
Preparing for the unexpected
: A 2024 Bankrate survey found that nearly 60% of Americans felt behind when it came to their emergency savings.
7
Consider using your refund to start, or shore up, an emergency fund, with the aim of having at least three to six months of living expenses set aside for a rainy day.
Adding to your nest egg
:
When it comes to
saving for retirement
, every little bit helps. Consider putting some or all your tax refund in your IRA (traditional or Roth), if you haven’t already reached the IRS contribution limits for those accounts for the year. You may also want to consider having less income tax withheld from your paychecks this year. While you may not receive as big a refund (or any refund at all) in 2026, as a result, you’ll be freeing up income to contribute more to your 401(k) throughout the year—and boosting your nest egg in the process. Your tax preparer can help you determine how much to have withheld.
When it comes to taxes, preparing in advance can help you save time and money. Get a jump start on moves you can make today and throughout the year to make tax season as painless as possible.

Should Investors ‘Buy the Dip’?
Mar 12, 2025
The volatile start to 2025 for financial markets may offer new opportunities for investors. Here are three strategies to consider.
Author
Lisa Shalett
Key Takeaways
Recent tariff fears have led to a selloff in cyclicals, leaving financial stocks undervalued, despite their potential for superior earnings growth.
Now might be the time to sell long-duration bonds at a potential gain, as current lower yields may not provide sufficient compensation.
Non-U.S. equities may benefit as the U.S. dollar weakens and the outlook improves for regions such as Europe and China.
About 10 weeks into the year, investors have already faced twists and turns. They have gone from being bullish about Federal Reserve rate cuts and U.S. tech companies’ dominance in generative AI, to worried about economic overheating and sticky inflation. And more recently, they have grown concerned about a “stagflation” scenario of slowing growth and rising price pressures, tied to rapidly changing policy from Washington, D.C. around tariffs and federal deficits.
Markets reflect this anxiety. As of late last week, the S&P 500 was trading down more than 6% from its peak on Feb. 19 and was down nearly 2% for the year. The 10-year Treasury yield had fallen below 4.3% from above 4.8% in mid-January, while the U.S. dollar weakened roughly 6% from its recent high relative to other global currencies.
Against this backdrop, is it time for investors to “buy the dip” and return to the trades that worked so well during the market’s recent bull run? Morgan Stanley’s Global Investment Committee does not endorse that approach, but we do see some opportunities for investors elsewhere, especially in the “soft landing” scenario of slower-but-steady economic growth and receding inflation that we anticipate. Here are three to consider.
Wealth Management
Underneath the Round Trip, Opportunity
Does the recent market turbulence present a buying opportunity? We think so, but not in the old leaders. Here are three areas to consider.
Share
n/a
1
Favoring financials:
Recent tariff-related fears have spurred a selloff in economically sensitive “cyclical” stocks, such as financial services companies, as investors favor defensive sectors. We believe this creates a value-oriented opportunity in financials, which are cheaply priced relative to their history. Wall Street analysts are boosting their earnings estimates for the sector and forecasting superior earnings growth in 2025. Also, financials may be among the biggest beneficiaries of a deregulatory agenda, which could help spur mergers and acquisitions. Already, there are signs of a revival in deal activity and a pickup in commercial and industrial lending. Financials also have the potential for cost cutting and productivity gains to buffer pressures on net-interest margins.
2
Taking profits in long-duration bonds:
The recent bond rally has featured a compression in the “term premium,” an underlying component of yields that reflects the additional returns investors would typically demand for risks associated with an uncertain policy outlook. It is hard to remember a time in the past 30 years when demanding this premium was more important. Consider not only the rapid pace of policy changes coming from Washington but also that the U.S. government’s unsustainable debt and deficits are likely to continue growing. Yet, the current lower term premium doesn’t seem to fully reflect these risks. In addition, bonds tend to struggle with stagflation, which is a rising possibility in the near term. Considering these factors, long-duration bonds may not offer investors sufficient compensation. We think there may be an opportunity now to sell these assets at a potential gain.
3
Adding non-U.S. equity exposure:
The U.S. dollar has recently weakened, as positive economic catalysts outside of the U.S. are burgeoning. Structural fiscal reform in Europe will likely lead to an acceleration in spending and investment, while a stimulus plan for China seems to be emerging. At the same time, a weaker U.S. dollar may increase potential returns on foreign investments, as stronger foreign currencies translate to more U.S. dollars when converted back. Investors may be rewarded for adding exposure to cheap non-U.S. equities that stand to gain from such catalysts and currency dynamics.
What Should Investors Do Next?
U.S. markets are adjusting to changes in policy and tech leadership, while the entire world is adapting to “Trump 2.0.” The question for many investors might be: Are the recent market drawdowns a buying opportunity? We believe the answer is yes, but not in the leading investments of the recent bull run, such as passive indexes that benefited from the rapid growth of U.S tech stocks. Stock picking is key.
Instead, consider being opportunistic in the recent market turbulence by adding some cyclicals like financials and domestic manufacturers, including mid-cap stocks.
Additionally, look to diversify regionally across emerging markets, Japan and select areas in Europe, taking advantage of the shifting momentum outside the U.S. and funding from long-duration rates.

Risk Considerations
Equity securities
may fluctuate in response to news on companies, industries, market conditions and general economic environment.
Bonds
are subject to interest rate risk. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall; generally the longer a bond's maturity, the more sensitive it is to this risk. Bonds may also be subject to call risk, which is the risk that the issuer will redeem the debt at its option, fully or partially, before the scheduled maturity date. The market value of debt instruments may fluctuate, and proceeds from sales prior to maturity may be more or less than the amount originally invested or the maturity value due to changes in market conditions or changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. This is the risk that the issuer might be unable to make interest and/or principal payments on a timely basis. Bonds are also subject to reinvestment risk, which is the risk that principal and/or interest payments from a given investment may be reinvested at a lower interest rate.
Bonds rated below investment grade
may have speculative characteristics and present significant risks beyond those of other securities, including greater credit risk and price volatility in the secondary market.  Investors should be careful to consider these risks alongside their individual circumstances, objectives and risk tolerance before investing in high-yield bonds.  High yield bonds should comprise only a limited portion of a balanced portfolio.
Yields
are subject to change with economic conditions. Yield is only one factor that should be considered when making an investment decision.
Investing in foreign markets
entails greater risks than those normally associated with domestic markets, such as political, currency, economic and market risks. These risks are magnified in countries with
emerging markets and frontier markets
, since these countries may have relatively unstable governments and less established markets and economies.
Because of their narrow focus,
sector investments
tend to be more volatile than investments that diversify across many sectors and companies.
Technology stocks
may be especially volatile.
Asset allocation and diversification
do not assure a profit or protect against loss in declining financial markets.
Investing in smaller companies
involves greater risks not associated with investing in more established companies, such as business risk, significant stock price fluctuations and illiquidity.
Stocks of medium-sized companies
entail special risks, such as limited product lines, markets, and financial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger, more-established companies.
Value investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. Not all companies whose stocks are considered to be value stocks are able to turn their business around or successfully employ corrective strategies which would result in stock prices that do not rise as initially expected.
Growth investing
does not guarantee a profit or eliminate risk. The stocks of these companies can have relatively high valuations. Because of these high valuations, an investment in a growth stock can be more risky than an investment in a company with more modest growth expectations.
Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”)
investments in a portfolio may experience performance that is lower or higher than a portfolio not employing such practices. Portfolios with ESG restrictions and strategies as well as ESG investments may not be able to take advantage of the same opportunities or market trends as portfolios where ESG criteria is not applied. There are inconsistent ESG definitions and criteria within the industry, as well as multiple ESG ratings providers that provide ESG ratings of the same subject companies and/or securities that vary among the providers. Certain issuers of investments may have differing and inconsistent views concerning ESG criteria where the ESG claims made in offering documents or other literature may overstate ESG impact. ESG designations are as of the date of this material, and no assurance is provided that the underlying assets have maintained or will maintain and such designation or any stated ESG compliance. As a result, it is difficult to compare ESG investment products or to evaluate an ESG investment product in comparison to one that does not focus on ESG. Investors should also independently consider whether the ESG investment product meets their own ESG objectives or criteria. There is no assurance that an ESG investing strategy or techniques employed will be successful. Past performance is not a guarantee or a dependable measure of future results.
Artificial intelligence (AI)
is subject to limitations, and you should be aware that any output from an AI-supported tool or service made available by the Firm for your use is subject to such limitations, including but not limited to inaccuracy, incompleteness, or embedded bias.  You should always verify the results of any AI-generated output.
Rebalancing
does not protect against a loss in declining financial markets.  There may be a potential tax implication with a rebalancing strategy.  Investors should consult with their tax advisor before implementing such a strategy.
The
indices
are unmanaged. An investor cannot invest directly in an index.  They are shown for illustrative purposes only and do not represent the performance of any specific investment. The indices are not subject to expenses or fees and are often comprised of securities and other investment instruments the liquidity of which is not restricted. A particular investment product may consist of securities significantly different than those in any index referred to herein. Comparing an investment to a particular index may be of limited use.
The
indices selected by Morgan Stanley Wealth Management
to measure performance are representative of broad asset classes.  Morgan Stanley Wealth Management retains the right to change representative indices at any time.

CLEAR
Cybersecurity and Fraud Awareness
At Morgan Stanley, we have controls and processes in place that offer fraud protection to our clients and our infrastructure. The following resources are intended to help users enhance those processes to further protect themselves from cyber threats.
Share This
The digital transformation of financial services brings convenience to our clients and enhances the way we do business. However, it also provides cyber criminals with the opportunity to defraud online users and steal valuable information and/or financial assets. Users who are less equipped with cybersecurity knowledge are more vulnerable to becoming victims of cyber threats and online fraud.
Cyber criminals may impersonate or claim affiliation with Morgan Stanley and create fraudulent websites, email domains, mobile applications, social media accounts and e-commerce accounts; send emails or text messages; and make phone calls in order to, among other things, solicit business or monetary payments from users.
Learn More
Online Investment Scams
involve fake and misleading investment opportunities that often appear to be low risk with an unreasonably high return. Bad actors often leverage social media platforms, such as online chat groups, fake investment comparison sites, gaming or gambling websites, or even dating applications—as well as texts and email—to find potential victims and execute their scams.
Bad actors may also create spoofed domains or fake mobile applications in order to impersonate trusted contacts or brands that appear to be affiliated with legitimate organizations in order to pull off scams. High-yield bonds and cryptocurrency investments are two of the most common types of online investment scams.
Generally, investment decisions should not be made based purely on information promoted through a social media platform or via text or email, especially if investment opportunities seem too good to be true. Seek professional advice if in doubt about any investment opportunity, and always authenticate the details of an investment before making a transfer of funds.
Important Notice
– Morgan Stanley does not send unsolicited investment offers via email and does not conduct business over social media. If you receive information regarding an investment opportunity offered by or affiliated with Morgan Stanley from anyone other than your existing Morgan Stanley financial advisor/sales representative, you should treat that investment opportunity with suspicion. If you are uncertain or have reason to believe that it is fraudulent, contact your Morgan Stanley Client Representative immediately.
Business Email Compromise
(BEC) is online fraud committed through spoofed or compromised email accounts. A user may receive an email that appears to be from a known source or trusted sender requesting information or a fund transfer. Typically, there is an unexplained urgency and/or a request for a change of payment instructions.
Generally, payment instructions should be authenticated using a separate, more secure channel. For example, in addition to email verification, details may be confirmed verbally by calling a trusted phone number (i.e., a call-back verification). Experts in fraud protection advise that you be sure to check for anomalies in payment instructions and compare emails such as banking information update requests against legitimate emails you have received in the past.
Important Notice
– Give special attention to the email domains of incoming emails. Emails from Morgan Stanley will always be from one of our official email domains, not from public domains (e.g., @gmail.com, @icloud.com). If you are uncertain or have reason to believe that an email is fraudulent, contact your Morgan Stanley Client Representative immediately.
Social Media Impersonations
occur when a bad actor creates an account on a social media platform for the purpose of impersonating an individual or an organization. The bad actor then uses the fake account to gather sensitive information from users or to solicit business and/or monetary payments from users.
Important Notice
– Verify the identity of anyone you encounter in online communications before providing them with any personal or financial information. If you are uncertain or have reason to believe that a person or organization claiming to represent Morgan Stanley is fraudulent, contact your Morgan Stanley Client Representative immediately.
Recruitment Scams
take place when a bad actor advertises fake job openings, job application coaching and/or interview training online. A fee is usually charged with the promise of an interview or internship/job opportunity. The bad actor may also pose as a career consultant and contact victims through social media platforms (e.g.,Telegram, WeChat). They may even impersonate staff of the targeted organization in order to issue fake employment records or reference letters.
Important Notice
– Morgan Stanley does not offer interviews, internships, jobs, job application coaching, interview trainings or any form of career consultancy through third parties, nor do we offer  “pay-to-work” internship arrangements. If you are uncertain or have reason to believe that an offer of employment or employment-related services is fraudulent, contact Morgan Stanley immediately.
Phishing
starts with an email that often looks like it’s from a trusted or legitimate source. The email will ask you to take an action—usually click on a link or download an attachment. The link typically takes you to a website that seeks to steal your personal information or attempts to entice you to download malicious software (or “malware”) onto your computer. Opening the attachment may infect your computer with malware.
Once the malware infects your computer, a hacker can use it to look at personal documents and information saved on your computer, such as a tax return. They can also capture the keystrokes on your computer (or take screenshots of sites you visit) in order to harvest your logins, passwords and other sensitive information. After hackers steal your information, they’ll often try to access your bank accounts or contacts, or sell your data to other cyber criminals.
Never click on a link or open an attachment from an unsolicited source, and don’t provide personal information when responding to an email request from an unknown party.
Ransomware
is a type of increasingly prevalent malware that accesses, locks and encrypts a user’s files. The bad actor then demands that the user pay a ransom to retrieve the encrypted files.
Credential Stuffing Attacks
occur when a bad actor uses stolen account credentials to gain unauthorized access to a user’s online account. A user is more vulnerable to this attack if they recycle usernames and passwords across different online platforms.
Identity Theft
occurs when a bad actor uses stolen personal information to commit fraud—for example, applying online for a bank loan or credit card in someone else's name. The personal information is often obtained through phishing or other online scams.
Additional Tips for Fraud Prevention
Create and save bookmarks of important and/or often-visited banking and brokerage websites in your internet browser to avoid inadvertently entering login credentials on a fraudulent website (i.e., misspelled domain).
Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to log onto any websites or applications used for financial transactions or that have access to your personal information. MFA is an additional layer of protection, beyond username and password, meant to verify your identity.
Keep your software, operating system and internet browser up to date. Software companies continuously improve security and offer new bug fixes with every update released. Installing updates as soon as they are available can help you better protect your devices against malware.
Run a reputable antivirus product on all of your devices regularly, including your desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile device. This will help prevent your devices from becoming infected with malware and may identify and address any existing infections.
Only download applications from legitimate app stores and never from a third-party app store, website or QR code. Third-party app stores or pop-up applications are more likely to contain malware.
Do not use identical or similar passwords across multiple websites and applications. If a bad actor compromises one of your accounts, all of your other accounts using that same password could be at risk.
Do not click on links or open attachments in unsolicited emails or text messages. Doing so may install malware on your device.
Avoid using public Wi-Fi hotspots in unsecure locations, such as coffee shops, airports and hotels. Instead, use a private mobile network and create a personal Wi-Fi hotspot with your phone if possible. If you do use public Wi-Fi, rely on a virtual private network (VPN) to prevent your internet activities from being intercepted by bad actors.
Limit the sharing of personal information on social media platforms and prioritize safeguarding your accounts. Make sure your security settings are as secure as possible. Never share your personal information or login credentials with anyone.
Contact Us
If you come across any websites, mobile applications, e-commerce accounts or social media accounts in the name of or affiliated with Morgan Stanley; or receive emails, text messages or phone calls from Morgan Stanley that you are uncertain about or which you believe to be fraudulent, please contact your Morgan Stanley Client Representative immediately.

Inclusive Ventures Lab,
20 Women Founders Who Have Raised More Than $1M
Mar 24, 2023
These alums of our in-house startup accelerator for underrepresented founders have all marked a major milestone as women entrepreneurs.
Key Takeaways
Startups launched by all-women teams raised 1.9% of all VC funds in 2022, a drop from 2021.
1
The
Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Lab
, a startup accelerator which helps underrespresented founders gain access to capital, aims to help close that gap.
This year, the Lab celebrates 20 women alums of the program who have raised more than $1M, a milestone achieved by fewer than 2,500 women in the U.S.
Last year, U.S. startups with all-women teams received 1.9% of the approximately $238.3 billion in venture capital allocated, a drop from the previous year
1
, despite the fact that female-founded companies continue to outperform the broader market when it comes to the median time it takes to exit.
2
Meanwhile, in Europe, funding to women-only teams dropped from 3% in 2018 to 1% in 2022.
3
Morgan Stanley Inclusive Ventures Lab
(the Lab) is striving to change that. Since its inception in 2017, our in-house startup accelerator—which provides access to capital, curated content and powerful networks to early-stage technology and technology-enabled companies led by underrepresented founders in the U.S. and Europe, the Middle East and Africa—has had 20 women alums raise $1 million or more in venture capital. Most recently, that honor has gone to Mandy Price, Founder and CEO of Kanarys, who has raised over $10M, a milestone only 20 Black women in the U.S. like her have passed
4
(including Lab alums, Elise Smith, Founder and CEO of
Praxis Labs
, Tanya Van Court, Founder and  CEO of
Goalsetter
, Lisa Skeete Tatum, Co-Founder and CEO of
Landit
and Reham Fagiri, Co-Founder and CEO of
AptDeco
).
In fact, raising $1M in capital is an achievement reached by only about 2,300 women total in this country as of 2019
5
—and only 289 Black and Latina women as of February of last year
6
. Here’s a bit more about a few of the remarkable Lab alums who have done so, along with some stats on their companies.

AI’s Next Leap: 5 Trends Shaping Innovation and ROI

The world’s biggest tech companies presented at Morgan Stanley’s Technology, Media & Telecom Conference, identifying five trends around AI’s next frontiers and its ability to deliver ROI for enterprises.
Key Takeaways
In 2025, technology companies are focused on building AI platforms that meet their enterprise customers’ needs for optimized performance, profitability and security.
In doing so, they’re partnering across the AI ecosystem of chips companies, hyperscalers, large language models, data and software companies, and grappling with U.S. trade policy unknowns and resource constraints.
The top trends in new AI frontiers and the focus on enterprises include AI reasoning, custom silicon, cloud migrations, systems to measure AI efficacy and building an agentic AI future.
The world’s biggest tech companies are vying to refine cutting-edge uses for artificial intelligence utilizations: large language models’ ability to reason like humans; frontier models that push boundaries in natural-language processing, image generation, and coding; and the creation of systems that integrate multimodal data across text, images and video.
In doing so, they are racing to capture more AI market share and meet the needs of their biggest customers—the enterprises that are investing in AI to cut costs and boost productivity. In return, they demand optimized performance, profitability and security.
“This year it’s all about the customer,” said Kate Claassen, Head of Global Internet Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley. “We're on the precipice of an entirely new technology foundation, where the best of the best is available to any business. The way companies will win is by bringing that to their customers holistically.”
N/A
C-suite executives from the biggest technology companies around the world gathered at the recent
Morgan Stanley Technology, Media & Telecom Conference
in San Francisco, where they spoke about their efforts to build leading AI platforms and partner across the AI ecosystem. They also discussed their challenges, including unknowns regarding U.S. export bans and
tariffs
as well as constraints in power and the availability of graphics processing units (GPUs). Five key themes emerged for executives and investors to watch:
AI reasoning and custom silicon fuel demand for chips
Hyperscalers see cloud migrations and AI workloads as revenue opportunities
LLMs see potential in AI reasoning for enterprises
Data companies zero in on evaluating AI
Software companies set sights on agentic AI
1. AI Reasoning and Custom Silicon Fuel Demand for Chips
AI reasoning is one of the biggest drivers of increasing compute demand, and thus semiconductors, said executives from companies that design and make chips. AI reasoning moves beyond basic understanding and into advanced learning and decision making, which requires additional compute for pre-training, post-training and inference.
Executives also highlighted that they are investing in capabilities to meet customer demand for tailored data-center architecture, in areas such as memory and power management, and custom silicon designed for particular AI tasks rather than general-purpose processing. Customers are debating whether to buy specially designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for specific uses; ASICs offer higher efficiency and performance compared to general-purpose GPUs, which offer greater flexibility and broad applications. ASICs demand may accelerate with increased adoption of edge AI on small devices in coming years, executives said.
“For chip companies, customer demand is in the breadth of AI workloads for programmable infrastructure,” said Marco Lagos Morales, Head of U.S. Semiconductor Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley. “What each customer wants in their data center builds is differing, and that means a much less prescriptive approach, starting with original equipment manufacturer designs.”
Executives also spoke about challenges to revenue growth, including continued foundry constraints due to the number of years needed to develop new construction sites and their physical limitations. They also underscored the unknown nature of U.S. export controls, with many saying they could not estimate the impact to their bottom lines until they know the criteria.
Recent AI advancements will harness the power of Jevons Paradox, to drive the long-term demand for AI and further increase the total addressable market for all participants in the ecosystem.

2. Hyperscalers See Cloud Migrations and AI Workloads as Revenue Opportunities
Hyperscalers, the cloud providers with the greatest computing, storage and networking resources, spoke about convincing enterprises to use as many services across their software stacks as possible, to create even bigger AI platforms with increasing market share.
Executives described robust capital expenditures on commercial cloud servers and expanding their AI offerings to improve AI reasoning, as well as creating specialized applications and progress toward agentic AI. They spoke about offsetting costs with customizable chips that optimize compute performance and targeting long-term utilization of their land and construction sites. They also addressed
recent advancements in AI
that improve computing efficiency as positive for their businesses, as it helps reduce costs and increase AI demand.
“Recent AI advancements will harness the power of Jevons Paradox, to drive the long-term demand for AI and further increase the total addressable market for all participants in the ecosystem,” said Dave Chen, Head of Global Technology Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley, referring to the effect when increased efficiency leads to higher overall consumption.
3. LLMs See Potential in AI Reasoning for Enterprises
Companies that have developed the world’s biggest LLMs intend to use the most effective chips and build the best software to offer AI services that become essential for companies and consumers. While the early use cases for LLMs were content generation, summarization and classification, the biggest untapped potential is in AI reasoning for enterprise data, LLM executives said.
Enterprises are currently using LLMs for customer support and chatbots, internal knowledge retrieval and search, content generation and marketing, coding automation and business intelligence. However, with AI reasoning, LLMs can help companies with context-aware recommendations, data insights, process optimizations, compliance and strategic planning. Executives spoke about expecting further accelerations in coding advancements. One estimated that the output of a single software engineer has already risen by 10 times or more. Among the earliest industries to fully harness tailored AI to do tenfold work may be biotechnology, for clinical trials and regulatory submissions, and law, for AI-powered paralegal work.
Most enterprises want AI models that can ensure the security of their data, which is why some LLMs are researching and trying to commercialize mechanistic interpretability, which aims to understand why a model does what it does. This is important for all companies, but especially those in regulated industries such as financial services. “LLMs are competing to deliver the best inference stack to enterprises, which includes reasoning capabilities and strong AI governance,” said Brett Klein, Head of East Coast Technology Banking. “With sophisticated reasoning and adaptive learning, agentic AI will be able to make decisions and take actions to achieve business goals with minimal human intervention.”
LLM executives also spoke about working with foundries to design and make custom silicon, to reduce the costs related to developing features such as recommender systems for ads or videos at scale. Many also said that recent AI advancements—such as continuous learning that enables adaptation based on recent interactions and updates without full retraining—are positive as software and apps proliferate, creating more real-world usage, data exposure and refined training opportunities.
Writing code has become much faster with AI, but now the value is in testing and understanding it and seeing if it works for the business.”

4. Data Companies Zero in on Evaluating AI
Companies in the data and cloud infrastructure ecosystem are catering to enterprises by building tools that can help them automate observability—the ability to understand a system’s behavior by analyzing the data it generates—and creating evaluation systems for their AI uses, to help customers drive
ROI
.
“Writing code has become much faster with AI, but now the value is in testing and understanding it and seeing if it works for the business,” said Enrique Perez-Hernandez, Head of Global Technology Investment Banking at Morgan Stanley.
“Data companies are building AI engines more focused on helping companies understand whether LLMs are working properly and doing the right thing for the business.”
Some data companies are partnering with LLMs to power frontier models that allow users without a business-intelligence background to derive insights. Executives spoke about the importance of building custom AI tools, such as chat interfaces, that can parse through entities’ structured and unstructured data, whether they are enterprises in regulated industries or countries where data must remain on premises.
Executives also highlighted the “data lakehouse revolution”—a trend to create unified data platforms that combine data lakes’ low-cost storage and flexibility with data warehouses’ structure and management features. This may involve partnerships with big corporations and other large tech companies in the AI ecosystem, to create best-of-breed AI and machine learning services for cloud integrations, cybersecurity, analytics, data sharing and industry-specific solutions.
5. Software Companies Set Sights on Agentic AI
Software executives spoke about their current use of AI for productivity gains in marketing and engineering and their longer-term prospects to gain market share in an agentic computing future. These companies are aiming to create large systems that deploy
AI agents
to make decisions, take autonomous actions and adapt to changing environments for real-world applications across industries.
Executives spoke about how next-gen technology is shifting toward personalized content and shopping experiences, taking form as assistants that are intimately familiar with users’ interests and queries. Many also warned against an agentic AI hype cycle, underscoring that investors shouldn’t expect profitability in the next three to five years.
“Software companies are vying to create larger operating systems that harness machine learning, LLMs, natural language processing, generative AI and decision-making algorithms to move toward an agentic future,” said Brittany Skoda, Global Head of Software Banking. “Eventually, such systems could prove to be incredibly valuable to consumers, creators and advertisers and across enterprises,” said Melissa Knox, Global Head of Software Banking.

Unlocking the Housing Market
Mar 21, 2025
A decline in mortgage rates could help boost home sales, with potential positive effects on the economy overall.
Key Takeaways
Mortgage rates don’t have to get all the way back to 2021 levels in order to unlock some supply in the U.S. housing market.
In a Morgan Stanley survey, 91% of people considering buying a home in the next six months would be likely to do so if mortgage rates were to fall to 5.5%.
Based on the survey, Millennials and Gen Z are likely to lead the next wave of homebuying.
More activity in the housing market would likely boost purchases of durable goods, though many other factors are at play this year as well.
Activity in the U.S. housing market is currently at its weakest pace in more than 40 years. But if mortgage rates in the U.S. come down, even without returning to historic lows, it could be enough to motivate homebuyers to make purchases, according to Morgan Stanley Research.  Although high prices remain a barrier to entry, a decline in rates could help restart the market’s momentum—which could have positive impacts on the overall economy.
“People have been stuck in their homes longer than they otherwise would have been because they have been locked in by the low rates of their current mortgages,” Morgan Stanley Strategist James Egan says. “For those households that have been delaying a move—for instance, people who would have traditionally moved to accommodate growing families—a mortgage rate of 5.5% or 6% could be attractive enough because of how appealing it is relative to the 8% level of recent memory.”
What Could Be Next for Housing
A combination of historically high mortgage rates, elevated prices and low inventory has driven existing home sales down to their lowest level since 1981.
It’s a sharp contrast from the period of 2020 and 2021, when millions of Americans took advantage of mortgage rates below 4% to buy or refinance homes.
A January survey of 2,000 people conducted by Morgan Stanley showed that, among individuals considering buying a home in the next six months, 91% would be either much more likely or somewhat more likely to execute on the transaction if mortgage rates were to fall to 5.5% from current levels.
The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate in the U.S. was at 6.65% in the second week of March, according to Freddie Mac
1
. In January, the rate surpassed 7% for the first time since May.  The median price for existing homes was at $396,900 in January, a 4.8% increase from a year earlier, the National Association of Realtors said in February.

The survey showed that home prices are seen as the main obstacle for purchases, with 37% of prospective homebuyers pointing to it.
“Responses to our survey are helpful in thinking through the evolution of the housing market in its current unique position,” Egan says. “As we would have expected, the record level of home prices presents a formidable barrier to entry. But relief on the mortgage rate front appears poised to catalyze action.”
Housing Activity to Boost Consumption
If lower mortgage rates do unlock the housing market, it could have implications for the broader U.S. economy.
“Housing flows into gross domestic product (GDP) not only through residential investment, but also through the impacts on consumption,” says Morgan Stanley economist Heather Berger. “Households spend more on durable goods following home purchases.”
Additionally, as home prices remain elevated and people grow the amount of equity in their homes, they experience a “wealth effect” that also boosts spending.
Millennials and Gen Z to Lead Homebuying
Morgan Stanley’s survey indicated that Millennials and Gen Z, or people born between 1981 and 2012, are the most eager to buy homes in the near term. Homeownership rates for these younger generations have decreased because of the record low supply in the housing market over the past few years and challenging levels of affordability.
However, the net financial wealth of Millennials has increased significantly over the past five years.
The survey data show that the most significant barriers to homebuying for Millennials and Gen Z were home prices, followed by credit scores, and then down payments. Mortgage rates came in as the fourth largest obstacle.
“Younger consumers’ ability to buy homes will be a large determinant of their wealth accumulation and future consumption,” says Morgan Stanley economist Arunima Sinha. “As home prices are no longer increasing, these pressures should start to ease. However, with housing activity still relatively low in the near term, homeownership rates will likely take longer to normalize.”
