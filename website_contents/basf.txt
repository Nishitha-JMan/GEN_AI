Circular Economy at BASF
The Mass Balance Approach
Chemical recycling of plastic waste
Sustainability
ChemCycling™
From plastic waste to virgin-grade products
Plastics do have proven benefits during their use phase – for example preservation of food loss in packaging applications, lightweight construction of vehicles, and building insulation. Plastic waste, however, has become a major global challenge. Globally, around 250 million metric tons of plastic waste are generated each year. Only around 20 percent of this plastic is recycled, thus keeping the material in circulation. Therefore, more plastic waste should be recycled overall. Solving this challenge and building a more circular economy for plastics requires innovation and joint efforts across the value chain. BASF will contribute to this by developing innovative technologies and products that promote the recycling of plastics.
A key pillar in this regard is our ChemCycling™ project. In this project on chemical recycling, we are working with partners to further develop the pyrolysis technology which turns plastic waste into a secondary raw material called pyrolysis oil. We feed the oil into BASF’s Verbund production at the beginning of the value chain, thereby saving fossil resources. By using a third-party audited mass balance approach, the share of recycled material is allocated to certain products manufactured in the Verbund. These products are independently certified and have the same properties as those manufactured from fossil feedstock. Customers can therefore further process them in the same way as conventionally manufactured products and use them in demanding applications.
The ChemCycling™ project focuses on plastic waste that is not recycled mechanically for technological, economic or ecological reasons. Examples are plastics with residues, mixed plastic waste fractions, consisting of different plastic types, which will not be sorted further or used tires which are not recycled otherwise. Together, mechanical and chemical recycling can increase the overall recycling rates and contribute to a more circular economy for plastics.

Facts about ChemCycling™
Complementary:
Chemical recycling can be used to process plastic waste streams that are not recycled mechanically for technological, economic or ecological reasons. For example, while sorted single-stream plastic waste should be recycled mechanically, chemical recycling can be used for mixed post-consumer plastic waste streams, consisting of, e.g., PE, PP, PS, for which further sorting is not economical.
Solution oriented:
Chemical recycling is an important addition to the recycling landscape. Redesigning plastic products to make them mechanically recyclable is not always feasible, for example, if this would lower performance or increase material consumption.
Virgin-quality output:
With chemical recycling, plastic waste streams can be converted back into feedstock for the chemical industry and allocated to products manufactured in BASF’s integrated chemical production network (Verbund) via a mass balance approach. These products have the exact same properties as those manufactured from fossil feedstock.
Ease of use:
Our customers can process these products in the same way as conventionally manufactured products and use them in applications with high demands on quality, hygiene and performance. These include, for example, medical applications, food packaging or safety-relevant automotive parts. This helps achieving higher recycled content targets for products which must meet highest quality standards.
Certified transparently:
Both the mass balance procedure, by which the proportion of recycled feedstock is allocated to the product, and the products themselves are certified by independent auditors.
Resource and emission saving:
By using recycled feedstock, we can save fossil resources. Additionally, products made with chemically recycled feedstock according to a mass balance approach release fewer greenhouse gases than conventional products from primary fossil resources. This is because the plastic waste is not incinerated but used to create new chemical products.
The ChemCycling™ project was launched by BASF in 2018. In the pilot phase, BASF presented first prototypes with customers. These included mozzarella cheese packaging, transparent refrigerator components and insulation boxes for sensitive applications. Since 2020, first commercial products were launched by customers, including pharma boxes, transport packaging and food packaging.
We have established partnerships with Quantafuel, Pyrum and New Energy. Quantafuel is a specialist for pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste and purification of the resulting oil, Pyrum and New Energy are specialized in the pyrolysis of end-of-life tires. With these partnerships, BASF has taken a significant step towards establishing a broad supply base for pyrolysis oil and towards offering customers products based on chemically recycled plastic waste on a commercial scale.
However, any new recycling process needs acceptance as recycling from market and regulators. There are still some open questions with regards to technology, economy and regulation. We closely engage with the relevant stakeholders to tackle these challenges.

Our Strategy
The chemical industry is a great business to be in, connected to almost everything. It is an essential part of our daily lives and at the root of almost all industries. Enabling our customers’ green transformation is the source of our motivation and will be the key driver for our profitable growth.
We will continue to be a company with a strong, broad portfolio of chemical businesses. This is what we are known for. It’s also what makes us most relevant to customers globally, across a wide variety of industries.
We want to inspire our customers to make us their partner of choice. So that they’ll choose us every day as the chemical company they work with and buy from. A trusted partner in creating their future success.
Our customers and their needs are at the center of everything we do. Everyone at BASF strives to create the best experience for them. Everywhere, every day.
Our product and process innovations allow our customers to innovate and grow in their respective markets. Our scientists and engineers make amazing things possible.
All our customers will transform their business models toward a lower CO
2
and more circular world. At different speeds. With different priorities. Our ambition goes beyond making BASF green: We will also enable the green transformation of our customers’ businesses. This will be the key driver for our profitable growth.
By delivering superior offerings to our customers, we want to grow profitably and create value for shareholders. Our winning culture will be a key enabler for the successful execution of our strategy.“
Markus Kamieth
CEO BASF SE
The playing field in the chemical industry is changing – so are we. With our new strategy, we are targeting value creation and are changing toward a performance culture. Four winning ways will make our ambition a reality and put BASF on a renewed path to success.
Focus
Our new strategy sets a clear focus on the management of BASF’s portfolio. Going forward, we will differentiate between our core businesses, consisting of the segments Chemicals, Materials, Industrial Solutions and Nutrition & Care, and our industry-specific standalone businesses Environmental Catalyst and Metal Solutions, Battery Materials, Coatings and Agricultural Solutions. We will apply different value-creation levers to strengthen and profitably grow our chemical core and to unlock the value of our standalones. A new approach to capital allocation based on clear portfolio roles of our businesses will improve capital discipline and cash generation. Enhancing the footprint of our core businesses in China, India and ASEAN will contribute to our future success.
Accelerate
We will simplify and accelerate how we get things done – for example by sharpening roles, by establishing flatter hierarchies, and by dissolving the regional dimension of our organizational structure. To improve our performance, we will further increase the entrepreneurial freedom of our businesses – and with it their accountability for business success. Harnessing AI across the company and in all functions will drive productivity, improve profitability and accelerate innovation.
Transform
We remain fully committed to our climate protection targets and the green transformation of our operations and product portfolio. Going forward, we will focus even more on products with sustainability attributes, where we see customer demand ramping up most. Building on the unique advantages and opportunities of our Verbund, we will increase volumes of recycled and bio-based feedstocks to drive Sustainable-Future Solutions and net-zero measures at scale. Like BASF as a whole, our largest site in Ludwigshafen will benefit from the change and growth momentum connected to the green transformation. Our goal: To transform Ludwigshafen into a leading, sustainable chemical site for Europe and a strong pillar for BASF’s success.
Win
We have the best team in our industry – with great competencies, strong shared values and mutual respect. To ensure BASF’s long-term success, we will further develop our company culture. Stepping up accountability, increasing speed and nurturing a mindset of continuous improvement are at the heart of our Winning Culture. Nine actionable
Winning Behaviors

The Mass Balance Approach

: Creating a circular plastics economy with chemical recycling
From plastic waste to virgin-grade products
Plastics do have proven benefits during their use phase – for example preservation of food loss in packaging applications, lightweight construction of vehicles, and building insulation. Plastic waste, however, has become a major global challenge. Globally, around 250 million metric tons of plastic waste are generated each year. Only around 20 percent of this plastic is recycled, thus keeping the material in circulation. Therefore, more plastic waste should be recycled overall. Solving this challenge and building a more circular economy for plastics requires innovation and joint efforts across the value chain. BASF will contribute to this by developing innovative technologies and products that promote the recycling of plastics.
A key pillar in this regard is ChemCycling
®
. Here, our partnerships focus on the chemical recycling using pyrolysis technology which turns plastic waste or end-of-life tires into a secondary raw material called pyrolysis oil. We feed the oil into BASF’s Verbund production at the beginning of the value chain, thereby saving fossil resources. By using a third-party audited mass balance approach, the share of recycled feedstock is attributed to products manufactured in the Verbund. These mass balanced Ccycled
®
products are independently certified and have the same properties as conventional products. Customers can therefore further process them in the same way and use them in demanding applications.
ChemCycling
®
focuses on plastic waste that is not recycled mechanically for technological, economic or ecological reasons. Examples are plastics with residues, mixed plastic waste fractions, consisting of different plastic types, which will not be sorted further or scrap tires which are not recycled otherwise. Together, mechanical and chemical recycling can increase the overall recycling rates and contribute to a more circular economy for plastics.

Facts about ChemCycling
®
Our Ccycled
®
product portfolio contributes to customer solutions for a circular economy
In ChemCycling
®
, BASF uses recycled feedstock derived from plastic waste for our broad Ccycled
®
product portfolio. The recycled feedstock is attributed to the certified Ccycled
®
products through a mass balance approach. BASF customers have successfully introduced Ccycled
®
products in various industries like (food) packaging, medical, textile and automotive.
We have established partnerships with Quantafuel, ARCUS, Pyrum and New Energy. Quantafuel and ARCUS are specialists for pyrolysis of mixed plastic waste, Pyrum and New Energy are specialized in the pyrolysis of end-of-life tires. With these partnerships, BASF has taken a significant step towards establishing a broad supply base for pyrolysis oil and towards offering customers certified products from chemical recycling on a commercial scale.
However, any new recycling process needs acceptance as recycling from market and regulators. There are still some open questions with regards to technology, economy and regulation. We closely engage with the relevant stakeholders to tackle these challenges.

What is a Ccycled
®
product?
Conventional fossil raw materials required to manufacture BASF products are replaced with recycled feedstock from the chemical recycling of plastic waste or end-of-life tires along BASF’s integrated production chain. The corresponding share of recycled feedstock, e.g. pyrolysis oil, is attributed to the specific Ccycled
®
product via a certified mass balance approach. BASF sites and Ccycled
®
products are third-party certified according to internationally recognized certification schemes like REDcert
2
and ISCC PLUS and meet the definitions by ISO 22095:2020. The recycled feedstock is not measurable in the BASF mass balance product. The cradle-to-gate PCF is calculated according to TfS Methodology using both a cut-off approach and an Upstream System Expansion (USE) approach. USE accounts for a credit for the displaced waste treatment from the first life cycle (e.g. incineration), thereby reducing the product carbon footprint compared to the equivalent conventional fossil product.

BASF Renewable Energy GmbH
M&A, Power Trading and Energy Expertise –
Renewable Power for BASF
About us
BASF Renewable Energy GmbH is responsible for the entire portfolio of renewable power at BASF. That means we make sure the demand of electricity at every BASF location is met at all times – and that the energy will be obtained from renewable sources. We represent the procurement and trading of Renewable Energy and set the pace and create new ideas for BASF on its way to net zero emissions. That implies building and expanding our own renewable power assets (“make”) and overseeing the acquisition of Renewable Energy with long-term supply agreements (“buy”).
The secure and efficient supply of sufficient amounts of energy for BASF from renewable sources and at competitive prices is a significant factor for reaching our goals and the target of climate neutrality.
Horatio Evers
CEO BASF Renewable Energy GmbH
The energy concept at BASF
BASF Renewable Energy GmbH does not only guarantee location-wide supply of energy from renewable sources, but also handles the centralized distribution of energy, the balance and the optimization of the BASF power supply all across Europe. BASF Renewable Energy GmbH has access to European power markets. This approach results in automized energy trade and a compensation of electricity according to demand.
BASF climate goals
BASF aims to achieve net zero CO
2
emissions by 2050. An ambitious goal. Until 2030 we already want to reduce carbon dioxide emission by 25% compared to 2018. That means our demand for Renewable Energy will skyrocket in the years to come. To ensure a reliable supply of energy for our European locations we will need approximately 25 terawatt hours of additional energy from renewable sources by 2040. BASF will meet these needs by expanding production capacity (“make”) and diversifying the acquisition portfolio (“buy”). The emission targets have been presented in detail during the BASF Capital Markets Day.
Capital Markets Day
At the heart of the long-term transition toward net zero CO
2
emissions by 2050 is the use of new technologies to replace fossil fuels.

Our impact worldwide
We believe that promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I) is not a "one-size-fits-all" approach. While we implement global programs, we recognize the importance of local initiatives that reflect the cultural and situational factors of each region.
Our dynamic network empowers local teams to develop and implement tailored strategies. This collaborative framework ensures that our DE&I initiatives align with the communities we serve and promote inclusion and equity in the workplace.
Our external engagement
Positive influence requires collective efforts. For this reason, BASF is involved in various regional and international networks as well as (partner) organizations, initiatives, and associations.

Agriculture
Agriculture
For the love of farming, the biggest job on Earth
Farming is the biggest job on earth – and it’s getting bigger and more complex. Throughout the world, society has a view on how land should be used, what foods should be produced and how much space for nature should be provided on farms. Added to this, dietary choices, food price and food security all add to the complexity of what a farmer’s roles and responsibilities are.
As one of the leading agricultural companies, we’ve spent over 110 years gaining a deep understanding of crops produced to combine transformative innovation with practical action in the field. We connect innovative, highly regulated products and digital tools with a farmer’s land and their know-how.
And we’ve developed a broad portfolio in India that comprises innovative crop protection chemicals, seed treatment products and digital solutions for supporting farmers in doing the biggest job on earth.
We know we can’t meet all of agriculture’s challenges alone. So we are working still more closely with our customers, the agricultural community, academia, peers and partners to better address the needs of people, the environment and the planet. Helping to feed the world and create a lasting legacy. We do everything in our power to build a sustainable future for agriculture by connecting innovation, customers and society.

Nutrition
The world needs efficient solutions for balanced growth
9 billion people but only one earth: In order to meet the demands of the future global population, we will need to produce more with less resources. How are we going to feed nine billion people in 2050?
We believe that chemistry can be an enabler to supply people with nutritious, safe and affordable food and also save resources. With our products and solutions we are contributing. Together with our customers we aim to identify key levers for a more sustainable value chain in the food and animal feed industry. For example, our products help to produce more efficient and environmentally friendly foodstuffs and nutritional products.
Human Nutrition
It is one of the most important tasks of our time to produce high-quality and safe food. Even today our products help to make food healthier and more nutritious, such as by enriching it with vitamins. We maintain a dialogue with our markets and customers to jointly identify solutions for tomorrow's challenges.

Animal Nutrition
A growing world population also means greater demand for meat, fish, eggs and milk products. Our efficient, high-quality products help our customers to grow profitably whilst also saving resources.

Women in BASF: Diversity & Development Opportunities
Women in management positions are still a rarity? We want to change that together! At BASF, we are striving to achieve a fair gender balance.
Our ambition by 2030: We strive to increase the share of women in leadership positions
- to 30% and that worldwide.* We have already achieved a lot, but we can do even better. Above all, we aim to develop more women at the three levels below the Executive Board. After all, women have the skills to do this and are role models in all leadership positions - their
positive influence
makes a particular contribution to a diverse corporate culture.
Our ambition benefits not only women who want leadership responsibility, but also the company and society. We are convinced that the most innovative ideas come from different perspectives - and we need them to solve current and future global challenges.
*In so doing, we act in accordance with applicable local laws.
Our journey in figures
Your benefits at a glance
BASF not only promotes you, but also offers individual benefits for everyone. The benefits mentioned may vary depending on the location. The following are some examples:
What we offer
Above all,
exciting and diverse tasks
in a company that combines economic success, social responsibility and environmental protection! At BASF,
teamwork
is a top priority, and our strength is connectedness and close cooperation - or in short:
the power of connected minds
!
Of course, this applies to all employees - but how does BASF support women in particular in achieving their individual career goals? Our focus is on creating a
safe and inspiring working environment
, promoting diversity and taking a clear stand against any kind of exclusion. This includes, for example, enabling
flexible working models
so that
career goals and private life
can be reconciled.
We also focus on identifying female talent at an early stage and providing them with development opportunities. This includes
individual
mentoring and training programs
that help BASF to fill the majority of management positions from its own ranks. Ambitious women have no shortage of
good role models
who offer advice and support: In the BASF Group, the global share of women in leadership positions with disciplinary management responsibility was already 29.3% at the end of 2024. In our growing
network of groups and communities
, women at BASF exchange ideas across departments - and this takes place worldwide.
BASF's
commitment to global networks and initiatives
to promote diversity is also an important building block for achieving the 30/30 ambition: In 2020, for example, the United Nations Women's Empowerment Principles (WEPs) were signed - consisting of seven principles as guidance for companies to promote equality and the empowerment of women in the workplace, on the labor market and in society.
Ready for a career as a leader?
With the
TOP START International Business Leader Program
we offer the best graduates from all over the world the unique opportunity to prepare themselves in the best possible way for a career in general management and to develop as a leader every day.
Walk along new paths: Marion Kuhn's wish for a job in an international environment has come true at BASF. Since starting her career in the TOP START International Business Leaders Program, the Austrian native has already worked in Germany, Eastern Europe, Singapore and Japan. For the past four years, Marion has been working in the United States as Director Sales Management Pharma Solutions North America. She leads a team of more than 20 employees in the Nutrition and Health division.
We want to create the best solutions for our customers. And to do that, we need the best team. An important part of this is the promotion of women – from technical professions to laboratory work and management. We support the UN Women‘s Empowerment Principles and have set ourselves ambitious targets for gender diversity.
Markus Kamieth
Chairman of the Board of Executive Directors, BASF SE
Career at BASF as a woman? Yes, of course, it's possible! At BASF, there are various networks that promote equal opportunities, such as "Women in BASF" or "Women in Production & Engineering". Our goal is to have more female managers: By 2030, we want 30 percent of management positions to be held by women.
Dr. Nicole Meier
Head of Construction Support Services
I like the fact that BASF offers almost unlimited opportunities to develop in a wide variety of areas. The internationality and the opportunity to work with people from all over the world distinguish BASF as a top employer. In addition to the wide variety of topics, BASF is an employee-oriented and very family-friendly employer. This is reflected in the flexible working time models as well as BASF's own childcare and health offers.
Saskia Bingemann
Product Manager in the area of Digital Solutions
Women in leadership positions at BASF
Six women with leadership roles in various areas at BASF Germany share their focus on leadership, what is important to them in a leadership position, and where they still see a need for action.
Chemistry is female - a campaign
Men work in the chemical industry - this is the image that is often still far too strongly embedded in society. BASF Poland wants to change this perception with its "Chemistry is female" campaign.
In exciting videos, eight women from typically male domains talk about their professional careers, their daily tasks and what it's like to work in an environment with predominantly male colleagues.
The Aniline Women
In 1890, BASF hires the first nurses to provide medical care for its employees. In 1918, the first female chemist is employed in the ammonia laboratory. The first female authorized officer is appointed in 1964 and Margret Suckale is the first woman to be appointed to BASF's Board of Executive Directors in 2011. Therefore, the history of women at BASF is almost as long as the history of the company itself. The booklet "The Aniline Women" focusses on the history of women at BASF. It provides insights into the living and working condition of women since the 19th century until today. In addition, it portrays selected personalities who have coined the image of BASF as well as the image of women at BASF.

Our climate protection goal
We work continuously to further reduce emissions from our production. We have set ourselves ambitious quantitative goals to this end.
On our journey toward climate neutrality, we have set ourselves ambitious goals and are striving worldwide to achieve net zero CO
2
emissions
1
by 2050.
In addition, we want to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions worldwide by 25 percent by 2030 compared with 2018 – and to achieve this despite targeted growth and the construction of a large Verbund site in South China. Excluding the effects of the planned growth, this means cutting CO
2
emissions in half in the current business by the end of this decade.
In 2018, BASF Group’s worldwide emissions amounted to 21.9 million metric tons of CO
2
equivalents. In 1990, this figure was roughly twice as high. The new 2030 emissions goal represents a reduction of approximately 60 percent compared to 1990 levels, which exceeds the European Union’s target of minus 55 percent.
At the heart of the long-term transition toward net zero CO
2
emissions by 2050 is the use of new technologies, which will replace fossil fuels such as natural gas with electricity from renewable sources. Most of these technologies are being pioneered by BASF in collaboration with partners and are currently in a pilot stage. Broad scaleup of these technologies will only be fully realizable after 2030. In order to accelerate the avoidance of CO
2
emissions prior to that date, BASF also continues to systematically implement continuous improvement processes for existing production plants. In addition, BASF will progressively switch to renewable sources to meet its electricity needs and intends to invest in wind parks to facilitate this.
1
The goal includes Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Other greenhouse gases are converted into CO
2
equivalents according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

.
In addition, we will also consider temporarily taking external offsetting measures such as purchasing certificates if the technical or economic environment does not permit a stabilization of emissions at the 2018 level using the above approaches. Sharp increases due to the startup of large-scale plants will be progressively offset. When deciding on investments and acquisitions, we systematically consider the effects on greenhouse gas emissions.
Schematic overview: development of the BASF Group’s greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1 and 2)
The BASF Group’s emissions reported under these targets in 2022 amounted to 18.4 million metric tons of CO
2
equivalents (2021: 20.2 million metric tons). The increase in natural gas prices in Europe due to the war in Ukraine, weaker demand due to a slowing economy over the course of the year and several lockdowns in China led to a significant reduction in production volumes and, as a result, emissions in 2022. This particularly affected the emissions-intensive ammonia value chain.
